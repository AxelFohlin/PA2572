Please know wifi is not available in the apartment. Shower head is not fixed on wall and not the very convenient kind especially for women with long hair to wash. Big and comfortable bed.,NEGATIVE
"Very small apartment, good position. We met at the arrival the neighbor of Daniel (Rolf) That was kind. But home was very chaotic with a lot of useless things, wardrobe was full pf clothes and we couldn't hang our clothes. Next time i will not come back there.",NEGATIVE
Just over the top Merci daniel,NEGATIVE
"I gave 3 stars only because of location and the fact that the owner was responsive about some of the many issues we had. Overall, we think they are very inexperienced about renting.We were disappointed, we have rented many times in Europe and really this time we encountered some problems. No privacy drapes on living room and 1 bedroom window (we had to hang some dark cheap fabric drapes bought by the previous renter). Kitchen was not clean (oven in real bad shape) old refrigerator toaster ultra small old microwave all in bad conditions, furniture including sofas and rugs are very warn sitting in front of a window without curtains, facing neighbors, iron not functioning. The owner replaced old pots that we had scratched clean but this was not enough to make us feel comfortable. Some art is extreme and too explicit, dark religious, and of sexual unnecessary display.We are liberal adults who love art but that was really too much.",NEGATIVE
"I appreciate Madeleine was trying to be nice and welcoming but unfortunately the service hosts provide to their guests is not just about being nice. As a guest I have expectations about cleanliness and description of the place I am renting and none of those expectations were met. The description of this listing is not accurate, it’s simply wrong. This listing is not a small house, it’s similar to a cottage next to a house that guests are only allowed to use when taking shower and wash clothes. It is very small with old furniture, the pictures of the inside of the cottage are not representative of its actual condition. Before my arrival and after my reservation: Madeleine initially asked me to postpone my check in for a week as she has other guests in the main house and I won’t be able to use the shower and washing machine in the first week. This is an unusually absurd request given that when I was making the reservation the calendar showed the listing was available on top of the fact that I was paying to stay in her place and wasn’t crashing there for free. After that she changed her mind multiple times whether I could use the shower (which is in the main house). At this point I wished that Madeleine would cancel my booking but she didn’t. I had to make a support request due to a big confusion about what I will and will not have access to. At the end I was told that I could use the shower. When I arrived to the areas and looking for the place I had to wait in the street for half an hour before Madeleine answered my phone call and I got the house number. The address in the listing is not accurate either. At my arrival the place was not clean, it was extremely dirty, it was not prepared for welcoming a guest. It seemed to me that someone was sleeping on the bed right up to the point that I checked in. The handler who handed over the keys to me told me not to use the toilet inside the cottage which contradicts what is written in description and what Madeleine replied after I cancelled the reservation. The tap water in the kitchen is not working, I would call that a non-functioning kitchen. I was hoping for a long peaceful stay but now I have to hop on several listings as I am not able to find a long term stay anymore. For future guest if you are looking for an actual small house, it’s not a place for you. I do not recommend this listing for long stays or any stays in the conditions that I observed.",NEGATIVE
"There are major things we did not like: 1. When we got the place Malin was not available so her daughter opened for us and we were told not to use one of the bedrooms. That felt very awkward and we felt non welcomed. After discussion with the daughter, she accepted that the agreement with her mom is to use all the rooms. 2. The place was not clean at all. We took photos and sent to the owner to document the situation. There was no empty space in the fridge for our food. And we did not know where to put our clothes because all drawer were full and we are a family of four. To be fair however, I rented the place a day before our arrival, so I understand that Malin might not have had time to prepare it for us. Especially when she was actually travelling and not in the house. But I was hoping and expecting that since the place is listed on airbnb, it should have been prepared properly already. What I liked mostly is the location, a quiet and safe place. Also my communication with Malin was very good and she was nice and helpful.",NEGATIVE
"In general the apartment looks like in the pictures, nevertheless there were a lot of unarranged things: the conditions of the apartment are not accurate, there are various details on the walls, the kitchen board and the bathroom (the toilet seat is broken and there was hair on the shower). The place was not cleaned properly, there was dust everywhere and the used candles were not thrown away. Also, there were dirty dishes inside the dishwasher and the cupboards were badly organised and messy. The closets or the storage space in the bathroom are not available. Overall, the price mandated does not correspond with the conditions of the apartment. There was a lack of interest in giving the guests an enjoyable experience, not mentioning the fact that the host asked me if someone could enter the apartment while we were inside (I totally understand is their property, but one is paying for a service and that also includes privacy and safety). The apartment itself has a lot of potential to be a nice and sophisticated space but the furniture and general conditions of the apartment leave a lot to wish for. I would not recommend this space for that amount of money.",NEGATIVE
"We were very dissapointed with the appartment as it was quite filthy: floors, windows sills, tables,blankets. Shocking was the kitchen where we have found dead worms in drawers with cutlers. Wi-fi internet have not worked as a password was not available, but finally after reseting a modem we could at least connect via a cable. Bathroom was very simple too. In total the quality of the apparmtent does not correspond to price we paid.",NEGATIVE
"Clean apartment in a safe area. However, do be advised that when I checked in the host spoke and understood very limited English. When I tried to ask a question during my check-in, her response was that she doesn't speak English. This could be a problem if you have questions or need help in English.",NEGATIVE
"This is a really nice apartment. It was well kept and extremely clean, and in a lovely part of Stockholm. There is a great cafe across the road that does delicious cinnamon buns, and I felt it was a clean and safe. The bedroom is in an alcove off the living room. I made a mistake when booking and didn't see that there was no internet -I really do think this should be in the flat description and not just buried in the list of amenities. Unfortunately the host was not great about responding to my concerns and we didn't get to meet at my scheduled arrival as she had to catch a boat. Overall a positive experience but I was a little upset about the lack of communication.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment was generally accurate to the pictures with the bedroom, living room and kitchen all being comfortable. The bathroom, and particularly the towels, were underwhelming. My biggest complaint with our stay was the logistical problem we faced in entering the building. Essentially me and my girlfriend were locked out of the apartment at 2am because we were not notified by the host that the code entry is not active past 9pm. We were eventually able to reach the host after multiple calls, but still were very upset we had to be locked out for almost a half hour in the middle of the night. After this experience, we will surely think twice about using Air B&B again as the benefit of potential cost savings and comfort versus a hotel are outweighed by the situation we experienced in this stay.",NEGATIVE
"First, the location is great and the people staying at the hostel were very nice. However, I did not feel good about the experience. First, the apartment pictured in the ad is not the apartment we received. Second, the ad said it is a two bedroom apartment. It was a one bedroom with four bunkbeds. Third, the clothes washer pictured is not in your apartment. It is in the basement of the building and accessible to everyone else staying in the building. This means you can hang out in the basement and guard your clothes or you can skip using the laundry. Fourth, the ""private sauna"" described and pictured in the ad is not in your apartment. It is also in the basement of the building and, if I understood the instructions, turned on for one hour a day for men and one hour a day for women. Fifth, after we were in Norway we received an email which said: ""I just want to be clear beforehand this apartment is part of our hostel ...."" The email then informed us that we would need to rent sheets and towels unless we brought your own. If you really want to be perfectly clear about something, put that information in the ad before someone rents the place. Sixth, this is a commercial establishment (hostel) advertising on Airbnb. There is no host/guest relationship. We were shown to our apartment by the clerk managing the front desk. Summary: Good location but not as advertised.",NEGATIVE
"My Husband and I stayed at the apartment for 5 nights, part of our 16 day Scandinavian trip. Upon first arrival, the apartment is located with beautiful scenic views and refurbished to high standards. It was clean and well organised. Mansour was quick at responding to any enquiries that we had. Unfortunately, the apartment was not equipped for our basic needs and requires some thorough updating. Some examples are: No toaster, no oven (Microwave oven only), overrused and damaged pots/pans and cutlery, lack of toilet roll supply, etc. We felt that the place hadn't been updated for almost 2 years. For a self-catering option, we were very limited.",NEGATIVE
A small Sous-Terain-Appartement. We spent three days with 2 adults and 2 teenagers. It was narrow but worked. There is water pump in the Appartement which disturbs in the night. The Appartement should be cleaned better. It wasn‘t really proper.,NEGATIVE
"The place is well-equipped; e.g. it has a washer, microwave-oven, cot, so you can stay for longer time, if you wish. Unfortunately, we had issues with cleanliness: mould was present on several surfaces in the bathroom, on the frame of the windows, on flowerpots in the window.",NEGATIVE
This is an excellent place with an excellent host. But BEWARE it does not have WIFI and this is a big problem since it is not advertised. This impacted our trip negatively and we had to go chasing around for some internet and could not have the business meetings we needed properly etc. Otherwise the host was great (SMS and call only) and would stay there again if WIFI becomes available. Otherwise I would NOT recommend this apartment.,NEGATIVE
"The place is situated quite far from the centre, but conveniently in front of the metro station. First time we reached the station (in the evening) it felt eery. However, Amaniel was kind and readily available and came to pick us up to avoid confusion. There is not really anything good available in the locality. I did not like the surrounding too. About the room, it seems to be different from the pictures posted. The window was not opening properly and so the room was smelling, and if we could open the window our bedroom would have been directly accessible from the public balcony, that too easily. Kitchen utensils and bathroom were not well made, although might be temporary issue but we resorted to use minimal utensils than we do normally and use the microwave. Not my best Airbnb experience.",NEGATIVE
"This is a two Room flat. For those who value privacy and modesty, know that there is only ONE bedroom and those guest must trapse through the other room to reach the bathroom or the front door. There is inadequate lighting and closet space.",NEGATIVE
"A cozy apartment right in the old town of Stockholm and a walking distance to everything. The apartment is equipped with everything you may need, however it wasn't renoveted properly: the bedroomwindow couldn't be opened, bathroom door opening in reverse (the handle door must be pulled up to open it!). Moreover, it wasn't so clean as we were especting (I had the feeling - and smell- that the pillow cover in the bedroom was dirty!!! as well as the towls weren't smelling fresh). The Host wasn't so reactive with us, we had to push for his reply when we booked the apartment. We didin't see him during our staybut essential infromation about the house were provided. A bit expensive for what you get ...",NEGATIVE
Pros: 1. Location 2. Space 3. Renovated bathroom/kitchen 4. Affordable Cons: 1. The place NEEDS deep cleaning ASAP 2. We were not able to close the window in the bedroom at nights 3. The heating element in the living room was leaking and could therefore not be turned on. 4. The sofa in the living room is gross and needs deep cleaning 5. The shower head in the bathroom needs to get fixed,NEGATIVE
"Only downside was it was really hot so, with the windows open, the street was a bit noisy. But top place",NEGATIVE
"Located toward the edge of the Old Town near many restaurants and bars. VERY noisy--big construction site just across the street, and super early morning (well before 6 am) deliveries using handcarts bouncing over the cobblestone streets just outside--somehow the windows seem to let in an unusual amount of noise, and even with ear plugs it was difficult for me to sleep (not a usual problem for me at all!). The curtains also did not keep out a lot of light, so beware in the summer that the sun goes down very late and comes up very early, adding to the sleep disruption. Care of the unit seemed to be a bit negligent--there was leftover trash, empty bottles of stuff in the bathroom, questionably dirty towels in the bathroom, and leftover food gone bad in the fridge when I arrived. The owner was aware of problems with the washer before I arrived, and did not communicate these proactively. Check in was easy, and the host was responsive about the washer issue.",NEGATIVE
"Agneta's apartment is charming, but it is not suitable for four people. Especially if there are old people in your group. The apartment has two bedrooms on two floors, and one floor is actually a basement. The upstairs is small and the basement is large. But the stairs to the basement is too steep for old people to climb. These steps are also too steep and narrow to carry down large luggages. The basement doesn't have restroom and WIFI. So it could become difficult to assign rooms. The kitchen can only accommodate one person at a time. I could see that Agneta's room is perfect for an adult couple. It is nicely decorated and is very clean. The couple could leave luggages upstairs, and still have enough room. They could sleep downstairs. The downstairs bed is comfortable. Agneta's apartment is reasonably priced for this location for two people. It is conveniently located in the old town, close to the Palace, the Viking line and the old town square. A couple could definitely have a very romantic and enjoyable time here.",NEGATIVE
"The location of Agneta's place is perfect for a stay in Stockholm. the apartment was very clean but quite a bit darker than what the photos show. I was traveling with my mum who is in her 60's and the stairs down to the bedroom were too steep for her. I would not recommend this place for those traveling with older individuals or small children. Similarly, the street down to the front door is a bit steep with big cobble stones which she also struggled with. The generator for the apartment seems to be located in the bedroom downstairs which runs all night, as such I would recommend bringing ear plugs.",NEGATIVE
"A bit expensive compared to other Airbnb's we've used in the past, but the location was great. The apartment itself is very small, but it worked for what we needed. Be aware that the stairs to the bedroom downstairs are uneven and would be difficult to use for anyone with knee or hip problems. Also, the bath towels were very uncomfortable to use. Also something to be aware of is that you cannot adjust the temperature (per the instructions left by the owner), and there were times at night when we were either very hot or cold. Overall, though, a lovely apartment in a wonderful area of Stockholm!",NEGATIVE
We kind of managed but if you have suitcases with you than apartment spread in three levels very uncomfortable. We did not know this about the apartment,NEGATIVE
"Stockholm is a great city and the house is located in a lovely, leafy quiet suburb and is a 10-15 minute subway ride into the centre and is a unique 60s showpiece. There is nothing wrong with the property or location unfortunately we were just very let down by the host for this villa on the first night of a special occasion. A big group us planned a surprise trip for my sisters 40th birthday, unfortunately had our first day and arrival dampened as we were locked out with no help. Our host didn't respond to any of my messages that day so I wasn't sure what was happening for check in. I wasn't too worried as he is a super host and so I was under the impression he was meeting us as he didn't supply any additional details or provide any communication at all that day or the day before for check in at 4pm. We arrived to the house in the rain and thunder and no one was there to meet us and the front door was locked. I tried calling and messaging the host many times with no response at all. It had a coded door so we read the manual on the website and hoped he set the code according to the manual - nothing was set. We were stuck out in the suburbs with our luggage in the rain on a Friday, not an ideal start to a surprise birthday weekend break. Two of our party were pregnant and highly uncomfortable, so I felt awful for them as it is the suburbs there was no where for them to go and sit to wait or use the loo while we sorted out the problem. I called air bnb once I realised we weren't going to hear from our host and they were helpful, my contact was lovely and sympathetic. They were trying to contact the host too with no luck. We tried all the doors and found a side door which luckily wasn't locked and got in the house. We felt a bit uncomfortable going into the house via an unlocked side door but were reassured this was ok by the air bnb help desk. We had to leave our luggage in the house unsecured and unlocked as we had a birthday dinner planned in the city and we didn't want to stay in. We ended up missing our dinner reservations for my sister's birthday party which was disappointing, so we ended up walking around until we found somewhere that would take a big group at that time on a Friday night. We didn't hear from the host until 9pm, which is 5 hours from check in and we finally got a code for the locked front door that we could use the rest of the weekend. Really disappointing service from a super host and not ideal when you only have a short weekend in the city. Otherwise it was a lovely city and...",NEGATIVE
I did not have good memory unfortunately. It was not well prepared. Check in was delayed for over 1 hour. Even after 4pm cleannimg was not done. It was little strange to stop kids playing trumpling for the reason that kids did not take off shoes because it was outside and wet on trampoline.,NEGATIVE
The house is big and would be fine for a large group of adults but it wasn't child friendly. It is definitely quirky. The rugs and carpets were old. It seemed like the owner spent more time on making sure lighting inside the house was timed to stay on all night rather than fixing the myriad of wires sticking out from walls or fixing broken blinds.,NEGATIVE
This accomodation was not what I expected,NEGATIVE
"Mikael was a friendly host and he accommodated our late check-in. The apartment is well maintained and in a great location, easily accessible to public transportation and close enough to walk to many local attractions. Despite this, I cannot leave a positive review for this stay because the building is undergoing major renovations and we were woken up everything morning around 7am to construction, drilling, and workers yelling at one another on the balcony. It was very unpleasant for our short vacation. That being said, I would recommend staying here but only after the renovations are completed.",NEGATIVE
"Unfortunately the apartment was not what we expected from a super host. You can book the apartment for two people. There is only one bed with a width of 120 cm which doesn’t meet the standard and at least should be communicated in the announcement. There was only one blanket, one shower towel and one hand towel when we arrived. We didn’t meet our host in person, therefore we immediately wrote him after checking in, but we didn’t get an answer. His wife then showed up later in the evening with a second blanket and towel. The apartment, which by the way is cute and very well located, isn’t as clean as described, especially the bathroom. There is a cleaning fee of €35 included in the price, nevertheless we were requested to “undo the bed. Remove all bed linnen, the bed sheet and pillow cases and fold it a separate stack on the bed.” To “Take out the trash (don't forget the can in the bathroom).” Considering the status of the apartment and the to do list before leaving, one wonders what for they are getting payed. One the whole, the apartment is okay, for one (!) person, but not a super host",NEGATIVE
"Despite being great located, and having fairly reactive host, our overall impression was quite bad because of the conditions we met there. We had to pay extra for the sheets and towels which were very old and stained. We found hairs on the beds, or blood stains on duvet. One of the room was located in very dirtyband smelly basement full of spiders. There was a lot clutter, it seems that somebody lives there on daily basis. Fridge was dirty, so did lots of kitchen equipment, and barbecue. There was mold in the shower as well. Host didn't reacted on the comment related to dirt and cleanness problems. just told us to replace the sheets but it didn't really solve the problem. good patios to spend mornings and evenings there.",NEGATIVE
"We stayed at Marcus place for 6 days and the place has pro and cons. Pros are that the place is spacious and offers lots of potentials in terms of location, size, equipment and outside/inside seating. Also if you have a dog it is a great place as the area is fenced. What is not good is that the cleanliness of the entire place. Bathrooms havent been cleaned in a while and fresh towels havent been provided in all bath rooms. Kitchen was not clean enough e.g. mold and old coffee grounds in the coffee machines. Marcus is a very responsive host and if cleanliness is way better it can be a good place to stay.",NEGATIVE
"I wish for your next travelers they will not choose your apartment for their stays. First, update your profile pic, it is weird to meet someone retired when you expect a 35 year old host. Then, a little bit of cleaning don’t kill anybody. Having to pay a rent of 600€/month and also having to vacuum our own room is unacceptable ! And let’s not talk about bathroom/toilets... Despite of that, the location is quite good. I don’t recommend this place at all.",NEGATIVE
"This was a nightmare! Room for 8pers, without windows, just one doors, every minute some like inside. No breatheble, my worst experience with accomodition since I was born. Do not go there!",NEGATIVE
"You get what you see. Location, check in were top, unfortunately the room was not clean at all, dusty, it did not smell fresh, a bit dirty and after urine, the carpet is really rocked down, very sad! We (7 People in a 8 beds room) had to make the beds for our selves, didn’t know that. The woman at the check in was very nice, offered us alle coffee while I was checking in, location is super central!",NEGATIVE
"My friend and I were surprised by our experience at Sara's flat. She Did not show up upon arrival (which was fine) but failed to provide any ground rules or suggestions. Did not show us where to dispose of the garbage. She left her plants all over her small apartment (at least 10+), which made it hard to move around. We couldn't even move the plants ourselves Bc there was no room for us to put them. The washroom is incredibly small. Sink wasn't even large enough for us to wash our hands. For that reason, we used the only table available in her small studio apartment to place our toiletries bag on. I understand she lives in her apartment, however, she had so much of her own stuff in the apartment that it made it nearly impossible for us to place our belongings and luggage anywhere. She did make any room for us to actually take things out of our luggage. This made our stay very uncomfortable and crammed.",NEGATIVE
The place is ok but it gets freezing at night. You will need to bring multiple layers of clothing. The owner also gets upset if you use her kitchen which weird because most AirbnB this is standard,NEGATIVE
A little bit dusty and the bathroom was not cleaned at all. There's no room for saving your clothes. The rest of the apartment and location was nice.,NEGATIVE
Do not try this house. You will regret---------if so--------very much.,NEGATIVE
"The bathroom unfortunately smelt of mold /sewer and the floors hadn't been vaccumed, also no coffee machine or tea pot. We also were woken at 7am by loud drilling in the building. Other wise, the metro was really close and the bed was comfortable. We were also accused of scratching the floors which were false accusations. Had high hopes for this stay in Stockholm but sadly they were not met.",NEGATIVE
"It is a nice appartement, located in a good neigborhood, close to the metro, supermarket and the beach. Unfortunately an outside construction was gooing on, during our stay. We were informed about that 3 days in advance, so we didn't have a chance to book something else. The whole house was under construction, there was no balcony, our windows were covered with plastic, so we couldn't get fresh air or had a view at all. Because of the construction, there was a problem with the ventilation and all the dirt from outside was spread through the whole appartement. All our clothes were dirty and dusty an the whole appartement to. We couldn't leave the appartement, because there was no other place available. The construction seems like a longer thing, maybe till autum 2018. Before booking, ask, if the construction is still going on.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is big, there were four of us and we had lots of space. Anna's friend Hans met us and was very kind. However there was no washer and dryer or free parking as the ad stated. We were especially counting on the washer and dryer as we had been traveling more than a week when we arrived in Stockholm..These two things cost us a lot of unexpected time to get our laundry done and money we had to spend that we weren't counting on. Frustration that could have been avoided if the ad had been correct. We were also left a two page checklist of how to clean the apartment before we left- including directions for scrubbing the toilet and mopping the floor. If I had known she wanted me to clean the apartment I never would have rented it. We have stayed in several Air BnB's over the years and this was such a disappointment. We really feel as though we were misled by the ad and the cleaning list was ridiculous.",NEGATIVE
"Due to Tailor Swift concert there were no hotel rooms to book in Stockholm that week and I had to book Airbnb. It was easy to communicate with Ewa (very nice person ) and the room is 20 min. walk near the Central station. I only stayed one day from 21:30 until next day 07:30. I must though say that the bed is very soft and not good. Best regards, Dorrit",NEGATIVE
"I really can't recommend this place to anyone. It's listed as energetic and eclectic, but in reality it's just a cluttered mess. The wiring is probably dangerous, the odors of incense lasted for four days (our entire trip), the fridge smelled awful, and there was no Wifi despite being listed. To cement this, our interactions with our host were very off putting. There were positives: great shower and a good location.",NEGATIVE
Never replied to my asking about the handover of the keys and then cancelled on Friday afternoon when we were supposed to arrive on Saturday morning. Ruined our Friday because we thought we would not be able to go. Organized a different apartment that only had one actual bed even though we had booked a place for four people. Would not recommend this host.,NEGATIVE
"Pros: Great restaurants and easy to get downtown with buses just around the corner. Cons: There was no place to put your personal belongings, clothes away. All closets were full. Maybe this was my own fault and I should have checked all bedrooms but, except for master bedroom, the other 3 beds were for young kids and not adults. There was no way my 32 year old son could sleep in the top bunk bed. So he ended up on the couch for most of the week. Not ideal.",NEGATIVE
"The house is great, beautiful and in a great location. Great that there are linens and towels available. But the host needs to improve the relationship with the customers. In fact, I had difficulty contacting the host. In two months I never saw him and especially at the beginning of my stay I didn't receive important information such as information on recycling (which I couldn't do as I didn't have the keys to open the bins), on heating the house, wifi password etc. No response to my calls and response to messages even 5 days late. The first day I came into the house I had to hang the laundry he had left in the washing machine.",NEGATIVE
"Orhan's apartment is 5 minutes away from the metro in a nice area with supermarkets and restaurants nearby, the location is perfect. Unfortunately, the apartment was pretty dirty, the sofa was supposed to be white, but looked grey with ingrained grime. 50% of the furniture that was in the pictures on the site had been changed to more basic, uglier options, ie table and chairs, coffee table and sofa. The fridge contained old food, leftovers which was yucky to clean. No instructioes were given as to garbage disposal/recycling. I had to rely on local friends for info on that. The pillows were old and the bed unmade when I got there. Mattress was too soft and uncomfortable, i am guessing old. There were old/dirty facemasks in the bedside table, along with dirty slippers and personal laundry hanging in the closet to dry. Towels were fraying. To top it all off there was no coffee machine and when I enquired (since it was listed) I was told to put coffee in a pot with water to make coffee. It took five days to get a coffee machine delivered, it finally arrived with complimentary capsules and chocolates. Check in was awkward since no instructions given and a bit nerve-wracking, same as check out, I wrote to Orhan the night before and only received a response five minutes before I left, I was going to leave the key by the door, since I did not know what to do with it. All in all a regrettable experience, as a new host it will help me think about what NOT to do in my own airbnb.",NEGATIVE
Very bad! They were very rude! The place smelled like weed and the host was making soooo much noise we were honestly so scared and would never recomend this! They were aggressive and seemd racist,NEGATIVE
"Please change out your iron. When we tried to use it, it shut down the electricity in the whole house and we had to borrow from the neighbors.",NEGATIVE
"This is a really nice house in a great location for accessing the Nacka nature reserve. I’ve stayed here before and got along well with the owner. Unfortunately this time my stay wasn’t so pleasant. Uffe was renting to a couple on a longer term basis -outside of AirBnB. They were very hostile on my arrival, in the absence of the owner. They took exception when I said I would isolate and take a corona test, as per Swedish Covid 19 guidelines. I think because they didn’t want to follow the guidelines themselves, or be asked to isolate if I were to test positive (I tested negative on day three). “We don’t believe in Corona virus” they said. The hostility continued when they said the next day: “why don’t you get a place on your own?” and demanded that I go with them to speak to the owner, eventually Uffe intervened as he was in the next room. On arrival Uffe said there was no breakfast, but would get some, a few days later he said he would stop breakfast because his guests were long-term, offering a 500 SEK note as compensation for breakfasts for my three-week stay. I accepted, though I thought it was a bit on the low side. I started to realise the house was very dirty, I cleaned the shared bathroom myself as it was pretty unhygienic. Raising this with Uffe on the morning I left, he apologised that there had been no cleaning for some months. Uffe warned me about the two guests (a couple from Germany) “They will try and convert you” he told me. Sure enough they did become more vocal about their anti-lockdown, anti-facemask and vaccine-sceptic views. They told me they had come to Sweden to escape the lockdown in Germany and pursue their activism in Stockholm. Uffe was somewhat critical of Corona policy but less extreme than his guests “It's really overblown” he said. He wanted me to have dinner with them, I declined with a polite excuse. Uffe didn’t appear to appreciate how uncomfortable this might be for other guests, or that it may have been a good idea to mention it before arrival. Given that he knew how extreme their behaviour was, I think he could have acted to prevent it getting further out of hand. I was able to enjoy Stockholm outside of the house and use my own skis in the forest, which was wonderful. I avoided conflict by being outside and staying in my room more, but would have liked to use the communal areas more. Four days before I left, the couple started up again at breakfast, asking: ”Would I take the vaccine?” when I answered “Yes” they started to argue very aggressively. I was trying to finish my breakfast and was backing out of the door, I felt attacked for answering their question with a very moderate/ mainstream view. The man gestured aggressively to his laptop screen: “look at the graphs, .. you won’t look at the graphs, are you scared?”. The tone of the conversation was beyond just expressing a view -it was very antagonistic. I remember thinking “jeez, I’m actually paying for this”. I told Uffe straight after I’d gotten free of it, I told him that I felt harassed in a shared space in the house. I said I no longer have fair access to the kitchen with the other guests using it for their campaign work, filling the table with two laptops. He offered me to sit in his office to eat breakfast, which is advertised as a really nice looking living room on the Airbnb website. The reality is that this is now his office where he works each day and a storage space full of boxes, books and papers. It’s was a real mess in there. I did try to use it the following morning and there was even more stuff on the sofa and table. For a while the other guests went away and it was easier, but when they came back they continued to take the kitchen -closing the kitchen door and taking over the table for their campaign against the lockdown. They were organising a demonstration in the city. It was an accumulation of bad experiences really: The harassment by the guests, Uffe’s failure to warn me and get on top of that. The lack of cleaning (while displaying ‘enhanced cleaning’ in the advert). The lack of breakfast, the false picture of the living room. I felt like I’d been taken for a ride. I reached out to Uffe for a refund. He offered me 2000 SEK cash. I’d had such a bad time that I asked for a refund of half the fee (it was by the time I left, the worst hotel/ BnB experiences I’d ever had). He accepted but it turned out this was conditional that I didn’t mention it to AirBnB, so he withdrew from any refund. To clarify I had reached out to BnB initially to register a complaint against the other guests, but because they asked me more questions that turned into a wider enquiry by AirBnB.",NEGATIVE
"Nice garden and full kitchen, though communication with the host wasn’t great.",NEGATIVE
"Pros: Location ok, the room was a good size. Cons: The sheets were dirty on arrival (hair and other indications they had not been washed). I asked the owner nicely if these could be changed (or laundered immediately) and he refused to address the issue. Further he became angry and shouted as I nicely tried to find a solution. I ended up sleeping on a towel - which sounds uncomfortable, but the bed was actually worse. It was saggy and very uncomfortable. Most hosts are happy to provide local transit information - I was wondering about how to get to the airport from the metro line. I was never able to get a clear answer and so I ended up going to the metro station and find out from a helpful attendant. The directions to the apartment are complex - I asked the owner to email them to me because offline access has never worked well for me in the airbnb app - and email works great. He wouldn't take this step (despite more than one ask) - which is very different from other hosts who usually accommodate the guest's preferred way to communicate and strive to make things simple. Overall, I would not stay there again.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment has a good location, in a green area with 2 supermarkets nearby. The bus station is very close and there is a bus which connects with the center of the city. The apartment is nice, modern and well equipped. However, it wasn't very clean. We found dust everywhere and the bathroom and sanitary ware were not clean. Moreover, the small room is full of toys even on the ground, so you don't have any space for personal stuff.",NEGATIVE
"My worst AirBnb experience. It was quite cold in the place but it’s an old apartment so we expected that and brought some warm clothes. And than we realised that there is NO HOT WATER in this apartment. To be precise somehow we had 2 hours of hot water in the morning between 8 and 10 to have a shower. But the reason we chose this apartment is because of the bath. And I literally cried of disappointment when I couldn’t get a chance to use it and relax. I was waiting for this vacation for months and this place ruined it. The response from the host was especially disappointing. All the emergency phones weren’t available (at 4pm on a Saturday) and we got an answer at night. The reply was that they “were sorry” but nothing can be done (to be fair they did bring us keys from another apartment with a working shower after 24 hours). We’ve been told that we could use her personal jacuzzi “but I live to far”. No regrets, no discount, no simple empathy, just “sorry, I don’t know anything”.",NEGATIVE
"The location is excellent, and the apartment offers beautiful views of Stockholm's rooftops. However, there is an issue with the skylight window in the bedroom, which doesn't close fully. This allows noise and cold air to constantly seep in from outside. Additionally, the apartment is managed by an agency that seems somewhat indifferent. As a result, you shouldn't expect basic provisions like salt or other essentials to be available upon arrival. No instructions were provided for the heating, despite nighttime temperatures dropping to 8°C.",NEGATIVE
"Easy and flexible check in. Apartment was quite clean, but lacking some basic amenities (shampoo, conditioner etc.) which would be easy to fix. There is a very large window in the bedroom which was open at the very top and impossible to reach, which meant we had to listen to the loud city sounds overnight and made it difficult to sleep. Not a deal breaker, but bring your earplugs.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is in a top tier location and the building itself is great. The host also allowed early check in, which was a huge bonus. The apartment has some noticeable issues, however. There was a noticeable, constant smell of garbage in the bathroom. Also, the second bedroom had a hole in the ceiling. In the bedroom itself, there was no side wall windows, and there was noticeable bubbling on the wall, presumably suggesting water damage in the unit. Overall, the location is impossible to beat, but you just have to be willing to sacrifice some quality in terms of the unit. The views from the unit are incredible and the building itself is very secure.",NEGATIVE
"It's unpleasant to write anything negative because I can tell that this host is generally conscientious, and the apartment is very comfortable. However, our stay was ruined by extraordinary construction noise (to the point that we could not hear each other speak), blight due to scaffolding that blocked the living room windows entirely, and the presence of workers using jackhammers on the balcony in the afternoons (during our son's nap time). I suggest making sure that the balcony construction is complete before staying here.",NEGATIVE
I think compared to other accommodation options in the area we needed to stay this was reasonablely priced. Just disappointed that the shower head was broken and held up by a hairclip. If it was 1 night then would have put up with it but just made showering annoying for a week there. The photos made the apartment look larger and cleaner than it was and we were not aware of the 'folding' shower - foreign in our country. They were contactable and helpful. Also disappointed that small things like no tea towels and there were limited paper towels. Not sufficient hand soap allocated and we ended up buying toilet paper. Not sure on what others expect when for staying this long in a place but those little things help out or at least clear expectations should be communicated.,NEGATIVE
"I have to admit to being quite disappointed with my experience of this apartment. It was clean and in a great location, but it was much shabbier and smaller than it looked in the photographs. It really could do with a refurb. It's a shame because as I said the location is lovely and overall the cleanliness was good, but there are definitely nicer spots in Gamla Stan.",NEGATIVE
"IKEA style flat, very lovely and clean! But a bit far away from translations and not very soundproof. The wifi was really unstable sometime even cannot be connected!",NEGATIVE
"A good cosy apartment for a couple of days in stockholm, only problem was the noise coming from the apartment above and you could hear steps quite loudly and also loud talking. Easy access to stockholm centre via train. Did not meet the host at any time, and asked for some advice via airbnb on the day before we arrived and never got a reply which was quite disappointing.",NEGATIVE
"Isolation is reaal bad. You could hear speech of house-owner and they could hear you also. Entry of house was not good, allways you feel bad yourself...",NEGATIVE
We Felt very unwelcome:(😰 Owner lives in very close space as this unit. Walls are very thin . We heard every conversation as the host lives above you right upstairs. Not very private. Host asking that the frt heater be left off to save power was more about Her than what the guest needs; Heat that’s Advertised in the rental should be able to be used !!! We had no problem to ask when we were not in the unit to turn off. However while we were there in the unit to leave frt area off was a little unreasonable. If we needed it and paid for it at the price you advertised then we should be able to use if we needed it. Also it was necessary with My husbands medical condition. Next Rules not to cook this or that …. We felt uncomfortable cooking anything My observance is that Overall you need to get more ventilation in the rather than ask your guest to not make any food that you might be offended by. If ventilation is a problem fix it or don’t provide cooking👍🏻 Overall your unit was clean and we had what was needed except the Hospitality from the Host that was simply not there.😰,NEGATIVE
"The house is ok for 5 persons but: Far from the center (around 30 minutes bus + metro). We have Not appreciated that in the house rules is written to use only the shower in the basament (because the other shower at 2nd floor is broken!) ...Not easy with kids who sleep at 2nd floor. PLEASE REPAIR IT!! The dryer was broken... I have to underline that one reason for that I have choosen this house was the clothes dryer...Moreover the toaster was broken, as well! I suggest to check everything before rent the house!!",NEGATIVE
"We don’t recommend Mats house at all unless you don’t mind not being welcomed, not having space at all for you and your family to empty your packs, not minding sleeping in a basement that is called a third room, using one bathroom instead of two and getting complains instead of being asked how your stay went. Shameful.",NEGATIVE
Mats is a nice person who always tries to help when there a problems with the room/ apartment or if you have any personal problems (e.g. he helped me to get my suitcase picked up by a courier). The accommodation is very close to the city center and the metro is running at almost every time even during the night. Unfortunately the accommodation is not clean (you are responsible for your own room but the kitchen and the bathroom were never cleaned during my 3-month-stay). Alternatively there was no cleaning plan. I also recognized a slight smell of smoke in the flat.,NEGATIVE
"Karin answers quickly, but the apartment is cold, the electricity is not strong enough and the view is mainly a 20m away building with windows of about 50 apartments that you can see in and with people who can see you - depressing!",NEGATIVE
The place was bad. Cluttered and crumbs all over the kitchen. Little to no lighting in the kitchen and you can hardly sleep because there’s no shades on the living room. Left hair and toiletries out in the bathroom. Not clear directions. Good location though.,NEGATIVE
Good. Not so good wifi,NEGATIVE
"If you have sensitive nose and suffer from allergies, try not using the sofa bed. I had a little trouble breathing through my nose .",NEGATIVE
"The flat is dark on the bottom floor on the inner yard. The ""kitchen"" is part of the entrance and virtually unusable. There were many things that were broken or did not work. The host fixed them but it took some time and should have been in order from the beginning.",NEGATIVE
"Zarah was a very kind and welcoming host, she did all her best to make our arrival great but we feel a bit disappointed after one night in her place. Because of the price, the description and the comments, we excepted something different than sleeping in the kid's room where the privacy is limited. The price was too expensive for just a bed, not enough space and a common bathroom despite the good vibes in the apartment, and especially we had to pick up in the fridge for the breakfast which is not the service we would have excepted for a ""bed & breakfast"". The place is quite far from the center, even with the subway which cost a certain price, and that's another reason why the price of the stay can't be as expensive as a place in the center (cleaning fee overvalued). It would have been more interesting to stay a few days probably, it's also maybe a kind of stay for another kind of travellers but not for us. It's not particularly Zarah's fault but definitely the limit of the AirBnB's system... :-(",NEGATIVE
"The property is minimalist, in a good area and Love was flexible with the check out time. Communication and check in weren't very smooth and the shower floor flooded within minutes of being in the shower. We were only provided with an address and Swedish phone numbers prior to arrival which aren't very useful when coming from abroad so we had to borrow someone's phone at the airport to figure out what to do. Ann had trouble describing the building and we aren't sure how we figured it out. The wifi password was written incorrectly on our checkin sheet so we had to go to a pub to call Ann to get the correct one. Not the most smooth experience but a fine place to sleep.",NEGATIVE
"PROS: The room is located near the center. It is clean and in a nice area with shops near by. CONS: the bathroom sink was broken, we could not use it during our stay. Love did not make any attemp to fix it or even talk to us. Also there was a strong oder in the kitchen",NEGATIVE
We got a sim with 1gb (not WiFi at the house) ... how about if your phone is not free? .... besides that we run out of internet after 10 hours and we stayed 3 days.... so terrible! I would not recommend it!,NEGATIVE
"The room was clean and sufficient but many things were a bit odd about the place and set up. I often heard snoring on the couch so never went into the living room and one time the elevator wasn’t functioning so I couldn’t get up into the apartment. It’s an old building so I understand but it could have been resolved through quicker responses. Communication was poorly done since before check in. That being said, it was a fine place if you are on a budget.",NEGATIVE
really nice and spacious home. the only negative note is the beds. very uncomfortable,NEGATIVE
"The description of this apartment was misleading. It promised 3 bedrooms, 1 queen and 2 double beds. In fact, the beds in bedroom 2 and 3 were child-size, not double beds. It was impossible for 6-foot tall adults to sleep in them. One of us had to sleep (barely) in the (dirty) living room couch. My son started sneezing on arrival and continued sneezing until we left after a day. The apartment is extremely cluttered and dusty, with almost no room for guests to store their things, as all closets, drawers and cabinets were completely full of the owner's stuff - toys, bottles, cans, food, bags, gadgets, knicknacks, photos, clothes, overloaded wiring, broken furniture, etc. Given my son's allergic reaction, we checked into a hotel after one day of our stay and he has recovered nicely. I have pictures. Host was argumentative and did not refund. The view out the window was quite nice. Great location.",NEGATIVE
"This place is in a lovely location in central Gamla Stan, many quaint shops and restaurants on the surrounding streets and walking distance to downtown Södermalm, Norrmalm, and Östermalm. We were very disappointed that the WiFi did not work during our stay. We were able to reach out to the host however the problem could not be fixed for several days. Since we traveled from the US this made communication very difficult.",NEGATIVE
"pros: location, size of apartment, easy and accommodating check-in. cons: dusty and dirty, floors, sinks, counters untouched indefinitely, dirty personal items left, moldy food in fridge, siders/bugs and webs/sacks in corners and on baseboards throughout. no trash bags in any receptacle but expected me to take out the trash. Host communicated well until I shared the level of cleanliness. Response came 10 hours later. At that time, she did not offer to address the dirt, adjust the price, or take ownership. I was told it was the guest's responsibility to clean the place. Hair dryer got hot in my hand when using. Street and hall noise easily heard. Overall value: bad. This was expensive for off season. It was the grand finale of my trip. Due to the filth I did not feel relaxed. I would not recommend working with this host or this apartment.",NEGATIVE
It's a nice apartment but the air was not fresh and it was not possible to change it even though we left the windows open ...,NEGATIVE
The room is nice with a window on a park But the apartment is a mess Impossible to have breakfast on the kitchen table Bathroom is a mess too,NEGATIVE
Above and over expectations,NEGATIVE
"Pros : - location is great , you can walk anywhere. - charming old building Cons: - The person attending the reception does not speak English. Comunnication was impossible. - The beds are horrible. The main bed has a matrass 10cm thick, with a yielded bed base that sinks to the center. I was told before making the reservation that there was another individual proper bed to sleep 9 days on : reality is I was offered a joke of a folding bed with a ""matrass"" 5cm thick, that collapsed as soon as my daughter sat on . Then I was told that I would be receiving a call from the owner to fix the problem, but I was never contacted. - Sofa : very old and sinking too. My daughter had to sleep on it for 9 days. - Light : Courtains don´t keep the light away. ( It hardly gets dark in Stockholm at the summer) . - Lift: It was out of order 5 days of the 9 I was there, ( it´s a 5th floor) . I didnt hear an apology or indication of when it would be fixed. - Wifi : It was non existant for a whole day. The rest of the time, on and off: it wouldnt let Netflix load properly or work. I had work videoconferences planned as I didnt expect to have wifi problems in the center of Stockholm. Again, no apology or help at all. - Terrace: lovely, but dangerous: I was sitting on the terrace and a piece of facade larger than my hand fell 10 cm away from my head. Around there were already some pieces of facade, it is falling apart, literally. In the same area but inside the house, the plaster is also collapsing, a piece of it fell on the sofa. - The views do not correspond with the pictures in the ad: there are heavy construction work going on in the watter area in front, it looks like a new harbour or maybe new metro station? something that must have been going on for a long time and still way to go. It should be said on the add : lots of noise and industrial views of cranes.",NEGATIVE
Great location. Very close to Metro and restaurants. A bit noisy at night if you opened windows. Spacious with lots of storage space. Difficult getting inside as we were given incorrect instructions and the lock box wasn’t working properly.,NEGATIVE
"For a short stay, this accommodation is suitable, but I wouldn’t recommend it for a longer stay. The room is as described, and the location is definitely a highlight. However, living with Maria over a longer period was not enjoyable. Renting out a room while restricting the guest's ability to feel at home is questionable, as it never really allows you to feel settled. Upon arrival, I was given a long list of rules regarding kitchen use. For example, it’s not permitted to eat after cooking and then clean up afterward; cleaning must happen immediately. This lead to the fact, that you will always eat cold food or you have to heat it up in the microwave. I felt as if I wasn’t truly welcome in the apartment. Criticism from Maria was frequent, yet any feedback from my side was unwelcome. On a positive note, Maria helped me with laundry, which was not included in the listing. Thank you for that!",NEGATIVE
We did not really enjoy this place. Very messy and not clean. Especially the kitchen. Dirty cabinets and cutlery. Stains in the pillows and the bed covers. Communication and location are on the other hand good things about this place.,NEGATIVE
"Unfortunately, this stay was my first really horrible experience for several reasons. The only positive aspect are the roommates, they are very kind! First the private bath was not working due to pipe-problems. Second the air of the kitchen and the other bathrooms accumulate under the roof. Eventhough i tried to fix this with closing the gaps of the door with towels my stuff smelled anyways. Second in the ad was states, that the shared rooms get cleaned once a week - which is not true, and if so its definetly not properly done. After stating that i want to cancel the contract because of these reasons the communication with the landlord got even worse. He didnt took my complains seriously and eventhough he knew that i am a student he was not cooperative at all and replied late when i tried to find a solution which is good for both of us. In the end i had to pay a lot extra without getting the promised service and had to leave and search for a new accomodation within one day for my own.",NEGATIVE
"The unit is spacious and the location is good. The kitchen is well stocked and easy to use. However the lighting in the house is not very good, very dark, the bedroom ceiling light does not work, bedroom TV doesn’t work, dryer isn’t working properly and we had problems with check in with the code and the app. Hopefully the landlord will fix these problems in the future.",NEGATIVE
"This apartment was not what I expected at all. It doesn’t have a bedroom or closet. The bed fills a small alcove in the kitchen, where it is on a high platform with a step ladder. The area under the platform was completely full of personal belongings. Every kitchen cabinet, kitchen counter, bathroom vanity, wardrobe, and shelf was completely full with personal belongings. The fridge contained a lot of food and the freezer was completely full of frost. There was nowhere to open a suitcase except the living room floor, and it would have been impossible to invite a local friend over to cook dinner together in the cluttered kitchen, which is why I booked an apartment instead of a hotel room. I felt so uncomfortable that I couldn’t even stand to spend one night, let alone a whole week. Thankfully, Airbnb gave me a full refund when they saw pictures I took of the place, but now i have nowhere to stay. This has affected my entire trip. I can’t even begin to express how disappointed I am.",NEGATIVE
A very basic apartment you just want to sleep in and not stay in at for a cosy evening.,NEGATIVE
We were supposed to arrive on Friday to collect our keys. Emil never bothered to answer our calls or messages which left us without any solution for the night. Thanks to Airbnb we managed to find an hotel later that night. Do not recommend,NEGATIVE
Absolutely woderful house,NEGATIVE
Toilet and bath not convinient - Cooking not possible,NEGATIVE
"This is my first negative review and I have waited for several days to let myself write it more objectively. Kerstin was mostly nice and communicative, and the place was clean. She let me use the washer for free but did charge us 20 Euros for two bedlinen (which was written on the website although I didn't notice when I booked). However, wifi was very weak in our rooms (on 2nd floor) during the stay. The problem was not initially acknowledged and later admitted but not resolved. We found that the wifi connection was much stronger on the 1st floor, which has spacial dinning room, big tables and lots of chairs, so suggested using laptops on the 1st floor, but surprisingly we were denied to use the shared space to work! The host said ""this place is not for work, you must work in your room"". After we stressed the importance of wifi for us and pointed out that wifi was listed on the web (but not now any more), she claimed that ""wifi is provided, you cannot connect and there is nothing I can do"". At the end, there was a cable to use in the rooms but I was using a Mac and I didn't have an adaptor for the cable, so that doesn't work. Of course, the host was surfing the Internet on the 1st floor. I understand that some hosts may prefer their guests staying in their rooms, but the host should make sure that a ""laptop friendly workspace"" has good wifi connection, not just a provided but barely usable one. And most importantly, the host should find (or at least try to find) solutions when the situation happens, instead of saying ""there is nothing I can do"".",NEGATIVE
"We obeyed house rules and did not bring alcohol onto the property, but we did come home drunk the first night and she was very angry and mean towards us about it. even though we are adults and can make our own decisions, and we where not disrespectful or loud. she said if we came home drunk again she would kick us out and terminate our stay. very authoritarian.",NEGATIVE
Really lovely place but not catered to the heat we experienced with no air con and windows that don’t open made for sleepless nights. The owner was kind enough to drop off a small fan but unfortunately not enough to break through the heat.,NEGATIVE
"I had a mixed experience… The AirB&B itself was chic, comfy and in a nice location. Unfortunately, I had a terrible experience with the host’s customer service… they didn’t provide me with all the check-in information, leaving me without a bed the first night I arrived, and costing me an extra £277 when I finally found an available hotel room (late flight). It was a real nightmare and I when I asked for a refund for that first night, the host diminished this and ultimately ignored me.",NEGATIVE
"Not a clean place. No toalette paper, dirty dish, dirty bed linen. Host is not very helpful. Uncomfortable mattress. Good location, nice, big apartment, calm place.",NEGATIVE
If you want to live in 3rd world country come to Yousef’s place Where all furniture are layered with heavy dust The walking closet drawers are dusty inside when u put your clothes in they come out dusty The bedsheets don’t fully fit on the big bed in the bedroom No sheet to cover with under the comforter The curtains are thin do you wake up at 3 am w the sun rise then you need eye patch to fall back into sleep The bedroom door is squeaky and you can’t close it bc the door lock fell off and he taped it w scotch tape The outlet in the bedroom fell off the wall so dangerous to use for charging The second bedroom the curtains even thinner impossible to sleep in it The living room the tv u usable bc it need password which Yousef doesn’t provide The very tiny bathroom smells like pure sewage gas and I used two air fresheners lavender scent and it didn’t help. There is no mirror in the bathroom. Also there was no shampoo or conditioner or even trash bags in the kitchen. Until three days later when I complained. He brought a body wash and trash bags a sheet that doesn’t fit the big bed and a comforter cover. He also brought back a very weird old towel that smelled funky. He brought teakettle paper bc he only provided one extra for two weeks stay. The place has only one dusty full size mirror in the living room . The living room has no actual lights only some little lights around the tv . The place for three days had no electricity in bedrooms it was hard to see in the evenings until he brought some bulbs There was no kitchen sponges and detergent to clean the dishes I brought some from my mom’s. Also there are no pot holders do one can’t use the oven. The seats in the kitchen around the dining table are dirty and the seat mats are filthy and stained. He is not reliable in answering messages he can take 3 or 4 days before he replies back The neighbors are loud and not considerate until midnight every night The porch outside or the balcony is very dirty one can’t go outside on it The floor was not cleaned so don’t walk barefoot it is yucky The walls in the living room are steamed with dark paints and they have stains When I arrived the bathroom trash bin was not emptied so disgusting Also he provided only one hand towel for two guests I guess he expected everyone to use same hand towel. After 11 days from my stay he offered to bring more I said no bc I brought some from my mom’s Don’t waste your money on this place. I have a video and pictures of everything sadly I can’t record the smell. But he a knowledges it in his texts on Airbnb,NEGATIVE
I was not expecting a 5 stars hotel but the sofa is covered of old massive stains. In one of the bed we found hairs. The other bad’d sheet were stained and the toilet smell from the drain constantly. The apartment should be for max 5 people and there was only one tea cup and 2 glass. I won’t choose it again.,NEGATIVE
We were disappointed in this room. It appears to be a converted cellar and consequently has very low ceilings and limited natural light. The bathroom is tiny with a very low ceiling and required stooping to get in the doorway. I wouldn't recommend.,NEGATIVE
They are not good people and in very bad form,NEGATIVE
"I checked out early in the morning - 9 am. The same evening i received a complaint written in Swedish -i suppose-, asking for penalty accusing me with damages?!. Not a good behaviour!",NEGATIVE
"The place was clean, in a good location, and had everything for a few nights’ stay However, knowing it was a little small from other reviews, what I thought would be cosy and quaint was just cramped. Bumped my head countless times which became increasingly frustrating. Ventilation in the bathroom is also no good. Meaning steam and condensation hangs around for hours after showers, keeping everything wet. Other than this we enjoyed our stay.",NEGATIVE
The apartment was fine but the biggest problem was the lack of communication. The owner sends automatic message where he offers leaving your luggage before the check in if you want but you have to let him know before to get the instructions where you can leave it. So I messaged him a few days before our stay and then a few hours before check in and didnt get any response at all so we didnt know what to do. It was stressfull because we didn't know if we should leave our bags somewere or check in earlier (we had keys left under the doormat). On the last day we get another automatic message and thats all.. I guess not only us had problems with check in because a few times (also at night) someone tried to open our door so we were a little bit scared and didn't feel save there. Also the blinds in the bedroom's window was broken so we had to have it close all the time.,NEGATIVE
Host blamed us for something we didn't do then tried to charge $400 for a drink spilled on a cabinet which would easily come out with one wipe of a sponge. Was extremely rude when checking out.,NEGATIVE
Was dirty house and many roommates. rooms without locks.,NEGATIVE
"I was not able to stay at Margaretha's place as I had to leave urgently for Finland. Throughout the planning for my stay and during the extraordinary circumstances of my having to cancel because of the Corona virus, Margaretha has been very kind and easy to communicate with. I am very disappointed that I was not able to stay with her and her family in Stockholm.",NEGATIVE
"Alex was not there when we stayed there, but he was communicative before our arrival. His roommate was there and we've stayed at many Airbnb's before and she is the most awkward person that we have ever met. She seemed terrified of us - we invited her to eat with us and she refused. Subsequent interactions were similar. She was talking to herself all day and night as if she was chanting a spell. The beds were not clean when we got there and she gave us sheets to make the bed ourselves. The entire apartment was strewn with paper. There were 2 beds in our room and 1 bed is unusable. You will sink to the floor while lying in it. The other bed was too small for 2 relatively small people to fit in. Internet was fast, water was hot, and the kitchen was spacious but otherwise I would not recommend this place for a true Airbnb experience.",NEGATIVE
"The beds are boxsprings with skinny foamies/mattresses on top, only 1 sheet Not enough room for 2 suitcases in the room...we had to remove the chair cause it wouldn't go under the table but that gave us room for backpack under the table....yippee! Disappointing.",NEGATIVE
Definitely a place for no more than two people that are close. Place was extremely small and was not fun to share amongst 3 people. Beds were highly uncomfortable. The cost of this place is high for what you actually get.,NEGATIVE
"Daniel was nice but everything was complicated with this appartment : the adress given on airbnb wasnt the same as the one he gave me, he wasn't here to ""welcome"" us, the appartment is really tiny (but that we knew), the sofa was broken so we could not unfold it to sleep, tons of laundry in the closets everywhere, the ""third"" bed (actually second because we couldnt sleep on the couch) was really unconfortable with a big gap in it ... We had to text him for the wifi, the sheets, everything really because he didn't leave us any note or whatever : he actually emailed me the ""protocole"" to get in the appartment 2 hours before my arrival, except I was coming from France so I didnt have any wifi or else. Sum up : after one night, I asked to be reemboursed and checked in to a hotel, which costed me a lot of money, and he didn't even offer to help up getting to the hotel with our luggages ... We lost a hole day dealing with this, he showed up at 11 in the morning to ""help"" us with the sofa, so we had to stay in ... Such a huge waste of time and money. Never again.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is located centrally in Södermalm, which is its biggest advantage. Other than that it was overpriced for what little it had to offer. We expected it to be small so that wasn't our issue with it. However, the facilities looked worn out and shabby. The shower curtain was discolored and dirty, the kitchen ware was sticky and didn't seem to have been washed before we arrived and the floor hadn't been properly vacuumed. What's more, there was a mop standing in a bucket of dirty water in the bathroom and a loose curtain lying around. The folding bed's frame was missing a slate in the middle, which made it even less comfortable to sleep on. In summary, the apartment did not look like it had been properly cleaned and prepared for us at all. After all, every guest pays a cleaning fee! I wish I could have given this place a higher rating. My friend and I did not have very high expectations, but the state in which we found the apartment was simply unacceptable. With a little effort and investment, this apartment could have earned a much better review.",NEGATIVE
"Compact and simple apartment in great location, but not a place you want to spend any more time in than sleeping. With the second fold out bed in use there’s almost no room to move. The fold out bed also has some missing slats on the frame so we had to place the mattress directly on the floor. The prior guests made a mess, which caused a slight delay in check in, which we were understanding of. However there was only one towel out and the others were in a pile in the closet; we were not certain whether or not they were clean or used by previous guests. Overall the apartment needs some more care and improvements to bring it up to standards of Airbnb guests.",NEGATIVE
"First we felt this is a nice place to stay, but then we found out it is not. When i opened the door of the wardrobe, all of the laundry fell on me, that was not a pleasent suprise. Then we found someone else's blood on the towel, and something sticky phlegm on the blanket, that were disgusting.. There was no toilet paper (i think it is a must), but many food leftover in the fridge. We had pain in our back in the mornings, the couch is not for sleeping, it is a used old one. After a long rainy day, we found that we lost the key of the flat. The host didn't help us, just asked do we have money to go to a hotel. We got inside on the other day around half past ten, luckily we could catch our flight back home. Ohh, btw the view from the flat is amazing!",NEGATIVE
"At the moment there seems to be some work going on in the building, which caused some smelling of paint inside the apartment.",NEGATIVE
Good location but unfortunately not very clean. Incomplete kitchen but nice view of the nature behind house,NEGATIVE
"The apartment is located in a nice area, and ok standard. Unfortunately very loud and poorly equipped.",NEGATIVE
"Room was clean, bed was ok. Shower head made a weird noise in a very high tone which was annoying. First night I was there I was woken up at 7 am by a carpenter I guess. The walls are very thin. On the second night I was woken up by housekeeping because she already thought I checked out…",NEGATIVE
"Caroline was friendly (although we never met --- I retrieved the keys from her friend). She was very kind to arrange a laundry appointment for me. I travel full time for business and this is the first time I've ever had to leave a review like this. However, I'd be remiss in not mentioning for other business travelers that the level of cleanliness and state of the property was highly disappointing and a bit shocking, actually. I showered mostly at the gym and couch surfed closer in to the city with friends as much as possible. This is no fault of Caroline's but the walls are incredibly thin. You will hear everything. The neighbors are very late night partiers which is fine if you're on vacation but if you have to be up early the next day, listening to drunk people play the guitar poorly at 4 in the morning is a little much. Again, Caroline was friendly and did extend the generous courtesy of setting up a laundry appointment for me. Additionally, the wifi is great. Unfortunately, the state of the apartment was not a good fit for me personally.",NEGATIVE
"Paulinas flat is clean and cosy and Paulina's communication is very good and it was easy to arrange everything. Unfortunately, it really is not suitable for 3 people as advertised. I think it is also difficult for 2. The bed is a large single and a bit too small or uncomfortable for 2. The sofa is too small for an adult and the airbed was just too uncomfortable and awkward for any of us. I was glad it was only one night",NEGATIVE
The place was adequate. Would not recommend for families with young children.,NEGATIVE
As soon as i arrived i was to by the owner that her neighbours was not happy me staying. I asked her why. She wouldn’t say. I then asked if i could use the machine to do my laundry. she said i would have to ask my neighbours. So i waited for two hours. No response so i went looking for the laundry room but could not find it so i went back to my room. The next morning i went out on a nature walk. By the time i got back early evening i was told to leave by Airbnb as they stepped through tje door. I then had to spend extra money i didn’t have on a hotel to stay instead. she did refund me. A bit bizarre if you ask me. She said she owns the place but her neighbours were acting like they own the place lol. Never mind. So it Didnt go as planned but it was easier to find another place to stay. Just unnesscary drama that didn’t need to happen.,NEGATIVE
"Fantastic location in old town and interesting building but some serious drawbacks. The wifi was poor and even cellular data didn't work properly in the home. The rooms have no windows, no circulation, no wifi, and very small blankets.",NEGATIVE
"Old town is a big tourist attraction and from that stand point the location was great. Our family was not very happy with the unit for following reasons. Unit is on the ground floor which is generally for businesses. Air circulation was very bad so you have to keep windows open. As a result you can hear street conversations and they can look thorough open window. All bedrooms are in basement. Though it has an element of being different, we had trouble adjusting. Air circulation was big issue and it was not an ideal place to sleep. A cupboard door was broken and we ran out of toilet paper. All in all our family did not have a good time in the unit. Though location has great advantage, it was well below our expectation and not at all value for our money. Sorry for a bad review but I thought it is important to paint a realistic picture for future Airbnb guests so that they can make informed decision.",NEGATIVE
"There are stairs in the apartment, which means the only bathroom is upstairs and the bedrooms are downstairs. The kitchen and bathroom are very rudimentary. There is no TV. There are no windows in the bedrooms so one could feel claustrophobic with low ceilings and no windows.",NEGATIVE
Average apartment little bit overpriced,NEGATIVE
"The house was really dark. The living area had two windows but not enough natural light and no ventilation. The property was completely overlooked and anyone walking on the street could look into the whole living area through the windows. The kitchen had barely any work tops which made even preparing simple breakfast really difficult. One of the bedrooms was unfinished with loose wires in the wardrobe, the door sill/saddle was loose and a trip risk and the door would not shut so this bedroom was not usable. The second bedroom had all the water pipes in which meant one heard all the noise of flushing, washing, washing machine etc form the top floors in the apartment. This was not very conducive to a good night sleep. Of the three bed rooms only one was usable. The bed rooms were in the basement and had very uneven, low ceilings and protruding walls. This meant a lot of head, shoulder and body parts bumping into the walls. The tap in the kitchen was also not fixed which meant one had to hold it with one hand to turn the lever with the other hand. The details of this apartment were mis-represented and instead of functional 3 bed room flat we paid for, we got a poorly finished one bedroom flat.",NEGATIVE
"Great stay, thoughtful touches. Unfortunately WiFi didn’t work half the time and when it worked it did not function downstairs, neither did the 4G",NEGATIVE
"This apartment is no worth the price of what you get. There is no ventilation system in the entire apartment; there are only two windows on the main floor but only one of them is reachable, and the basement (where the bedrooms are) has no windows at all so the air gets stuck there, which makes it not Covid-friendly at all. Besides, there is no isolation system. From the bedrooms, you can hear EVERYTHING the neighbours do and if you are unlucky, they won’t stop playing music and talking loud until 6 am. That’s what happened to us and it was a complete nightmare to sleep there because we didn’t get proper rest. The owners tried to help but in the end, there was nothing they could do if strangers were throwing a party. Despite the location being ideal, we’d not go back to this apartment.",NEGATIVE
"We have mixed feelings about this apartment. We knew there wasn't a lot of windows, but we didn't know that the few windows there are don't bring any light in, and that's it's also very moist and smells down. The location is great, the beds are good, and the first night it's quite a fun experience to sleep in a cave. But after a few days it gets really depressing and we had to spend as much time as possible outside of the apartment. Also, there is no WiFi and no signal in two of the rooms downstairs ; the third one gets a little bit of WiFi, but otherwise you have to be upstairs. We were also surprised that this is advertised as a 6 persons appartement ; there is indeed 6 sleeping spots but only 4 chairs, and very little kitchen equipment. It worked fine for the 3 of us but it would have been more complicated if there was 6 of us.",NEGATIVE
"The host was not answering, the fridge was really dirty as well as the bathroom, the pictures were corresponding to the reality",NEGATIVE
"Very dirty, very much noise from up neighbours I couldn’t sleep, rooms are horrible, so humidity and I could not breath special that I have some breath problem. There was one man who come inside without let me know . And all was just horrible.",NEGATIVE
"We were looking forward to our stay at Robert O Yasmin's apartment. Unfortunately, when we arrived, we discovered that the apartment we checked in to was not the one we had booked, and we were given no warning in advance. The new apartment was on the ground floor, had hardly any windows, and the bedrooms were located in a musty basement with no windows. I reached Robert (I think?) on the phone and he didn't offer much by explanation. Another person -- Johnny -- who worked at a nearby hotel that manages the property, came by and showed us the original apartment, which had almost no furniture in it and was scattered with other items and boxes. He only said that there had been ""a problem"" with it and didn't elaborate further. They offered to let us stay for free in the new apartment or at the hotel, which wasn't great either. Neither of these were what we had bargained for, and we ended up scrambling to find another place at the last minute. We understand that unexpected issues can happen, but the fact that they did not communicate about it at all before our arrival -- and only poorly so after -- really made me think that whoever runs this place is not a very committed host. I'd steer clear of any properties hosted by these people in the future.",NEGATIVE
"Bad internet connection, no windows in rooms. Drain pipes are exposed in the ceiling and walls of the bedrooms. Electric plug sockets are out of the wall which felt a bit unsafe. Host is super nice and easy to talk to. Unfortunately, it was an unpleasant stay for a business trip.",NEGATIVE
"Great location, nice host and good communication. The stoves did not work unfortunately",NEGATIVE
"I read the reviews and was aware that the rooms were in a basement. What others have not mentioned is that this basement has no fire escape. The rooms did not have any fire alarms, correctly placed smoke detectors, or extinguishing equipment. In addition, there were fans running constantly to fight the humidity and heat. The window by the stairs did not have any curtain and people could look straight in. None of the windows was possible to close properly. On top of that, two of the rooms did not have internet access. All in all, it did not feel like a safe place to sleep. It is a shame, as the place itself is cool and has charm. Other complaints were that there were no bathrobes, was dusty (particularly on the pipes and ventilation), and there was no Wifi password available when we arrived. The fans were noisy and the switch didn't work. Water from somewhere else in the building went through one of the rooms, which also was noisy. A place to avoid, despite the stellar location.",NEGATIVE
"Location great, but the apartment wasn’t cleaned good, and there were a lot of noises from above.",NEGATIVE
"Very affordable and maybe worth for a short 1-3 day stay. Great location, spacious, easy to find & check in. However, some things to note: - 3 bedrooms, but each room has 2 small beds and not 1 large bed! So it’s really a 6 bedroom apartment. The beds were very tiny and we did not enjoy them. - The bedrooms are downstairs, and in 2 bedrooms there is no wifi. There is also no phone service because of stone walls. So you don’t have any internet at all in your bed. Couldn’t make calls, send texts, watch videos, send emails… very disappointed. - Cleanliness in bedrooms not great, floor very dusty. Also fairly sure there were bed bugs and we will have to disinfect all our belongings…",NEGATIVE
Slow response after 8-10 hours. Not helpful .If you have luggage don't come because approach road is very steep. Away from city local conveyance is expensive to the city centre. You will not get even sugar for tea or coffee in kitchen.,NEGATIVE
I cannot recommend this place.,NEGATIVE
"The main (and critical - we are living in 2021, not in 1980) issue of that apartment- is the Internet. Unfortunately they don't have a wired connection inside of the place. The router is put somewhere, where you don't have an access to, and the only thing you have for you - it's the Wi-Fi connection through an extender. It seems like the router is very far from the apartment - so, any disturbances with the extending grid cause disconnection. In addition to that, the router itself doesn't work properly (may be because it's overloaded by lot of clients connections) - so, you may expect 5-10 mins outage of the Internet >10 times a day. I don't know why they can't have a router with a wired connection inside of the apartment. May be because they are trying to save some money paying for only one shared connection to the provider, or may be it's something because of the housing company limitation/requirement. Anyway, the current owner doesn't look willing to resolve the issue. The only thing, that we've got from him - the suggestion to compensate the mobile internet, we can use through our phones. So, if you need a stable Internet connection for your work - I strongly recommend avoid staying there (at list until the owners manage to fix that). Other than that - everything was near to perfect. There are almost everything you may need for a long stay - vacuum cleaner, iron, coffee-machine, dishes, linens etc. Even the floor in the bathroom is heated. The apartment is very big and has a lot of windows. In addition to that, if you come when the weather is warm - you may have a dinner on the balcony near the forest, using candles on the wall. That's very romantic.",NEGATIVE
the bed have to be cleaned to kill the bed bugs,NEGATIVE
I am not getting words how to describe the host. The apartment was nice and decent but the host is too weird. It's difficult to express what she did and same is not expected. We stayed at her place for three nights and after leaving she sends me three pictures. First one was her torn couch It was shocking to see that as I have no idea about it. At first instance failed to understand the same. The second picture was of used towels. I dnt know what is the host expecting as there was no washing machine in the apartment and if we are staying there for three nights it' is obvious that we will take shower and use towel for the purpose they are ment for. The third picture was of the kitchen shelf were there is little bread crumbs. I used the kitchen for three days and cleared everything. All was cleaned from the kitchen utensils to shelves everything. Infact the garbage was even thrown in the garbage bin on the other side of the house to keep it clean. It's shocking how people react. Everything was used with proper care and still people act like this. Host created a ruckus out of nothing and asked me to pay damages. The behaviour is shocking and if this is the case then I think people should prefer hotels instead of these apartments. I am grateful that she didn't accused me of anything else. Like her attitude she can do or say anything. I still cannot digest how people point out finger at others. I think Airbnb should take strict action against such host. So that innocent people doesn't suffer.,NEGATIVE
Far from city center but near the metro station and supermarket. The apartment located in a place I think it's not safety that much and check in method is unsafe(Anyone can get the key before I arrive). But the room is new and clean. Should add washing machine in the kitchen.,NEGATIVE
"The space was okay. The double bunk bed wasn’t big enough for two adults to sleep comfortably and I had trouble as a 100lb person getting up to the bunk bed bc the space was tight. The real issue for me which I should have checked which is why I am mentioning, the check out was ridiculously early, is was 10am I’ve never had such an early check out before. Our flight was in the evening so I asked if we could check out a bit later or leave our luggage for a few hours. The paper guide in the apartment said bags could be left till 1pm but when I asked we were told we couldn’t leave them past 10am. Also had to take out our trash to the other side of the building which I’ve never had to do before with Airbnb. In conclusion space was fine but don’t count on hospitality. Pros: modern apt good appliances and wifi connection.",NEGATIVE
Difficult parking if you arrive by car,NEGATIVE
"Very clean and really nicely decorated, bed very comfortable. Had our 12 month old son with us and we were supplied with a nice cot and high chair. Unfortunately the entrance to the Airbnb wasn’t the easiest to get up with a pram/baby. The place is up a hill with uneven steps which wasn’t on the listing, if we had known this prior we probably wouldn’t have booked. Also you have to park on a different road not outside the Airbnb which again was inconvenient for us as a family. Wasn’t as rural as we expected from the photos but once you get down to the lake it was beautiful!",NEGATIVE
"1. Put away your tons of private belongings. There is photos and clothes of the host and their family every where, cant even hang up my clothes in any of the wardrobes and even the hall was full of tjeir shoes and jackets. 2. The 2 fridges are stuck with food so dont expect to be able to buy other foods. 3. Many furnitures are old, it looks nice but it isnt nice as it is. 4. The place is not clean and full of personal stuff. I had a birthday dinner on the day before the day of checking out. We were making food and drinking he said i shall be the one throwing the trashes. I paid 2000 sek for ”cleaning service” and he told me that i shall be the one cleaning and throwing trashes! 5. The shower doesnt have proper shower sealing so water comes outand i had to take a towel to put on the floor. 6. Basically everything was just a huge disappointed especially when i paid 660 euros for 2 nights. 7. He blamed me saying that i took his beer but i did not. I dont even drink beer. 8. He said you not allowed to sleep on the couch!?!?!? 9. The lamp frame was loose so i took it off from the lamp and he said i broke it wtf? 10. We dont even smoke and he said we put cigarette on the floor. 11. I had a birthday dinner so ofc there will be a lot of food that we cooked and it will be messy day after - with the high cleaning fee ofc i expect s maid to clean. But he said he dont have a maid and he will clean himmself - why even put up such big lie? 12. Its not even correct door code as he deseibed it so we had to wait outside the door on day of check in until 18:00 pm. 13. I have videos and photos of how every room looked like before i started using the place and its so crazy how he can say that i put sway hes stuff. Ofc who want to see 700 pictures of his family? It supposed to be rented out and less personal. 14. Basically the whole summary pf this place is not worth 375 euros per night. We wear three people. 15. Also my friend forgot her keys in his condo he refused answer calls and return it 16. Also be careful, his neighbour especially the elder lady in white hear. When we tried to go into the door at check in she said we dont live here and tried to not let us in. - His unit is rented under black and not approved by the management building to rent out, so the management chiefs might make him forcesale his unit because of breaking the swedish law in rentinh it out. And just because i left so much to dish he got so angry hes putting up a bunch of crazy lies, Like for example i took hes beer?!?! Or i put cigarettes on his rough?!?!! That i broke the fridge ?!?!?? The freezer the down part the boxes is already broken and Stacked with hes own food. And that i put hamburger on the couch?!?! -.- 17. I have properties myself and have rented out and rented others places during my 6 years of frequently travelling international. And first time in my life i meet sn host thst cant take responsibilites for his own cleaning. Why do i have to do the dishes and throw trashes when there is a cleaning fee of 200 euros!??? *message to owner: Du ska också vara väldigt försiktigt med dina lögner. Jag kanske också borde berätta till din förening att du hyr ut olagligt och till skatteverket så att du kan börja taxera på alla dina tidigare och framtida olagliga uthyrningar. Att gå på mig personligt och ljuga om saker som vi inte har gjort är en synd. Jag är katolsk och när man ljuger hamnar man i helvetet. Så hoppas du får det bra i helvetet. Amen",NEGATIVE
Great location. Very stilish apartment. Only negative points: there is no space for your clothes (everything has to stay in your suitcase) and the kitchen is not really set up/equiped to cook.,NEGATIVE
"Perfect location but far from perfect designed bathroom. Shower was not working properly, also no ability to use washing machine as listed in description.",NEGATIVE
"Lovely place, lovely location. However, no AC on bottom floor in summer creates a very stuffy environment (and you can't open door to common patio to vent it). Very difficult (stressful) to check in as check-in instructions are completely different than listed instructions attached to listing that host sends separately after the fact only after you complete other separate agreements .",NEGATIVE
"We stayed in the apartment 3 nights. The position is good, in city old town center. The apartment could potentially be cozy if the cleaning conditions were not so poor. The whole apartment was full of dust. We found hair on our pillow cases and for one of the beds the sheets were clearly unwashed and the smell was not good. In the bathroom the shower carpet was in indecent conditions as well as the drawers of the kitchen.",NEGATIVE
Unfortunately we didn't have chance to meet cause I had problems with the flight.,NEGATIVE
"The house was nice and looked like the pictures. However, the landlady did not make me and my friend comfortable and questioned our legitimacy and even wanted to take photo of my ID. This led to us not wanting to stay more than 1 night when we had booked for 3.",NEGATIVE
Nice apartment with clean facilities. The only negative was that there seem to be a problem with Ants all around the apartment and in the kitchen.,NEGATIVE
"fairly old place, towels are rather stained and dirty. Host very unresponsive. it took her 2 days to reply, airbnb says with in an hour usually.",NEGATIVE
"The was some good things and bad things about our stay in this apartment. The communication, location and assistance with baggage storage were great. The main complains are that the shower was not fixed after a previous guest had complained and the entire bathroom floor was flooded and towels were all wet on the floor. This made the showering progress very uncomfortable. There were also so evenings and mornings where there were no warm water. Just something to note is that the kitchen is super tiny and not suitable if you want to cook proper meals but its good enough for a quick meal. Overall I would not recommend this apartment to another quest except if the shower is fixed then I would.",NEGATIVE
"The pros: The location is excellent and the beds are very comfortable. The check-in instructions were easy. The layout as described. The cons: We had significant problems with the hot water, meaning that one person took a 10 minute shower, and then there was no hot or even warm water at all for more than at least 4 hours after. Maybe longer. We have up waiting. The heat did not work in the bedroom or the bathroom, despite there being two radiators in the bedroom and one in the bathroom. The host seemed surprised, but due to there being a (very small) space heater in the bedroom, it seems as though maybe someone was aware the heat did not work prior to our arrival. The small space heater was not effective in heating the bedroom, and we had to layer our scarves and towels on the bed the first night. The host had someone drop off a larger space heater the next day, but only after we got no reply to our messages for more than 12 hours. We also planned to do laundry utilizing the washer and dryer listed in the amenities the night of our arrival and following morning, but there were on a different floor of the building, through a couple doors and there was no indication anywhere in the apartment of where they were located, so we had to rearrange our schedule and lost hours due to this. We heard back the following day after inquiring to the location. The coffee maker, toaster, tea kettle, and kitchenette area as a whole was all quite dirty. With various splatters on the walls and crumbs all over the counter and under the appliances, it looks as though it has not been properly cleaned in a while. The checkout instructions do advise to clean your own dishes and it seems that beyond what the previous guest dishwashing skills consist of there is no further consideration. There was no hand towel supplied in the kitchen. There was a roll of something, thinner than the toilet paper. Great location, but would not stay here again.",NEGATIVE
The house is nice but it is not clean and it’s very very very small. The Kitchen has only a electric cooker and it’s possibile to cook only by one pan a time!! I found the fridge and the cooker hood really dirty. There’s no lift and it’s on the top floor.,NEGATIVE
"After 30 or more Airbnb experiences this is the first one that was a disappointment. The flat is falsely advertised as having an open fireplace. It does not actually work, so don't expect making a cozy fire. The checking in process was not smooth, the host forgot to send the details before my arrival and the cleaning of the apartment was very poor. Several other details were disappointing, such as the hall lamp not working and hanging freely from the ceiling, the loose door handle to the bathroom and the wifi that was too poor to handle m video calls. Overall, very little attention to detail and not very corresponding to the images presented. I normally would not be too bothered, but there were simply too many faults to be acceptable, especially given the price. The fact that the host did not get back to me on any of these points is disappointing also. As a host on Airbnb myself with a fairly high rating I would be remiss not to mention the above. On the plus side, the bed was comfortable and the sauna very nice. Not nice enough to compensate for the many faults, but still. Not a lot of apartments offer this feature, and it is quite pleasant in winter. It is also in a lovely part of Stockholm, so the location is very good. With a bit more energy put into it, faults fixed and cleaning routines shored up, I am sure it can be a lovely home away from home for future guests.",NEGATIVE
"While location was great and it was nice to stay in Gamla Stan, we received very poor treatment compared to many other Airbnbs we have stayed in before. We never received the towels we asked for, the dishes were very dirty, many items were broken, and the kitchen was very close to being dis-functional.",NEGATIVE
"I recommend to read the listing very closely as this is a two ROOM apartment, not a two bedroom. It was a tight fit for our family of four as the kids room doubles as the sitting room and dining room. The kitchen is both tiny to the point of being unusable and was incredibly dirty. Sponges and cloths were absolutely filthy. We had to purchase new sponges and cleaning clothes in order to clean the grime off the dishes and glasses before using them. There were also only three water glasses. Location is great. We liked being on the quieter side of Gamla Stan. Check-in was a little complicated as the address the AirBNB app leads you to is different than the address provided in the check-in instructions, so be sure to use the check-in instructions.",NEGATIVE
I reported the shower is broken and there’s no attempt to repair. No shower gel provided. Floor mat in the bathroom was not provided as well. When reported more towels were provided not floor mat.,NEGATIVE
"This was our last two night after being away for 60 days. It was our most unpleasant accomodation on our trip with the description of the place not what we got. It’s 52 stairs, with no outdoor area, it’s only one bedrooms (second bed is in the dining room) no stainless steel oven, toaster and kettle old and pealing, no water, harbour, city or lake view as the description says and no blind on the dining room window with 21 hours of day light. Location was great but disappointing when I asked Airbnb to make the host take down the incorrect information so that people are getting what they pay for and their response was “write a review if you’re unhappy, we can’t make hosts rewrite their listings”. It’s a great location but I think it’s important that the listing is correct.",NEGATIVE
Only noticeable thing is the clogged kitchen and washroom drains when water drains,NEGATIVE
"Putting a bed into the living room and calling it a second bedroom is unethical. AirBnB should check on stuff like that. The decor is outdated and shabby. The ""dining"" table is wobbly, and the plastic chairs are ugly, as is the weird privacy curtain around the bed in the living room. The kitchen doesn't look like you want to cook anything in there. But you can always use the microwave in the living/dining/bedroom/kitchen. Looking over some older reviews, it is apparent that whatever breaks at some point just won't be fixed or replaced. The blinds in the living/dining/bedroom/kitchen have been down for a year or so, and the problems with the shower have been mentioned before. I guess as long as people don't read the reviews and go by what the listing says, someone will rent the place and nothing will change. But that's a common problem with all short-term rentals.",NEGATIVE
Checking in was difficult; information was not relayed and when I reached out the owner was fairly rude. This is 4 flights up some very narrow stairs. The space is pretty small with virtually no kitchen.,NEGATIVE
"𝐂𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐧𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 The place was very dusty... In the bathroom there was a fan of some sort covered with dust and all around the wall and the glass shelve had a thick layer of dust. There was something I don't want to know what is on the front of the sink and short black hairs in the bathtub. Make-up spills on the shower curtain. The kitchen was, I think not cleaned before us arriving, the stove and backsplash was filthy, the wall behind had some food spills and drawer dusty and not cleaned. In the bed in the common area, there were the same short black hairs in the bed and somebody forgot their sock under that bed. Cob-web in the light above the golden bed. 𝐀𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐲 It would have been good to have in the description that the apartment was on the top floor without an elevator (65 steps). We were a party of four - one 80 year old, one recovering from an open heart surgery, one 34-weeks pregnant. We only had hand luggage, fortunately. What the photos don´t depict is that the second bedroom is very small and has no oven, so it was very cold. And the kitchen is very small. 𝐕𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞 (𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐰𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐦𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐥𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐛𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞) Clean the apartment after every guest like you would want to have it if you were arriving yourself. Lie in the beds and take a look what your customers see when they lay in bed, sit on the toilet or at the dinner table.

"Nice apartments in a good place, but you definitely need to fix some details, they spoil the impression of this good place. The bath was very leaking and there were problems with the internet. I hope everything will be fixed and I will return to this wonderful place again.",NEGATIVE
The bed in the main area was subpar. Outlets were hanging out if the wall looks n need if repair. The tub had no drain stop. Impossible to shower without a holding stand for the shower head.,NEGATIVE
"Great location and super clean, but interior isnot super practical",NEGATIVE
"Unfortunately the apartment is completely worn out, a broken cubboard, broken mirrors, torn up pillows, missing bed lights and so on. Some things were solved right away, other things could not be solved that easy. We agreed on a discount.",NEGATIVE
"Great location and this is all the possitive . Host was very unclear from the very beginnig about time to check-in, saying we ""might"" be able to check in earlier, and/or we can leave our baggage ""in the hotel"", without mentioning what the hotel name is, what's the address of the hotel, or leave a phone number so we could arrange this ourselves (though a good host would arrange for us). Then, when we went into the room at 8pm, it turned out it was not cleaned at all. No sheets, no towels, it was like noone expected us to stay there. All the blankets, pillows etc. were left messy on the beds and couches, even on the table. We waited for one more hour for someone to come and bring the sheets and towels. The guy said it was already cleaned(!?) but it wasn't at all - was dusty, stains on the tables, i myself cleaned spilled coffee from one of the chairs in the living room. and we were offered bottles of Fanta and CocaCola left from the guests on the app-t on the lower floor(!?!) -annoying!",NEGATIVE
"We all get sickness and vomited special my 6/11 years old kids can’t get out, kids and mum never get out because of vomited . In stairs short ceiling I banged my head a few times. Handrail was have nails and injury my kids when he went up. This place was in 5 floors over 66 stairs and no lift . I am having physically issues just imagining how I climbed the round and scary stairs. I’ve got lots of pictures but I don’t like put disgusting pictures but if any one asking I’ll do. Regards",NEGATIVE
"Well I had stayed there before and to be honest was quite dreading coming back.My other airbnb experiences on that trip had been bright and wonderful. But this host's cancellation policy was strict and I would get no refund . So as I had only one night to spend before my flight home I decided to go with it. The thing is the neighbours severely object to airbnb and so the guests are put under severe constraints. Even turning the key in the lock would disturb them. Talking is a no no. The neighbours themselves make a lot of noise as is normal anywhere. but they are legit , I guess ! I am a superhost myself and so I really hate to have to state negative things The host herself is quite sweet. But it would help if she kept a hot jug and some tea coffee sugar. There is nothing. Only some teas left behind by other guests.No sugar in the house ! But nice of her to leave a bowl of cherries for me.The amenities are minimal and completely outdated. There is a plastic pipe going from under the potty to the water inlet. What made me really uncomfortable is that despite all this the host makes you sign a document which states that you will pay an amount outside of the airbnb resolution centre if amenities are damaged ! I seemed reluctant to sign because the amenities were minimal and could have done with refurbishing .She said signing was not mandatory but argued and I knew beyond a point she would not relent till the night was up.So I signed .Location is great though so if you are ok with other constraints .",NEGATIVE
"The place is easy to reach but not private. The room is between the living room and Tommy's bedroom, which means that he has to enter your bedroom to reach his room. So really a wide corridor that is the room. This was not clear at the time that I booked the room. I was very uncomfortable staying there. Between the noise from the main road, which is meters away from your bed (so no sign of the river as the photographs suggest) and the TV in the main room, don't expect a peaceful night. The dog Zelda is nice and quiet, but there is a distinct animal smell in the apartment.",NEGATIVE
"This wasn't really the kind of Airbnb I like to stay in. I think something that is really important to note is that there are two bedrooms as described. But if you are staying in the one that is furthest from the living room you have to go through the other guest's bedroom to get to your own. I didn't feel very comfortable with this set up because it meant having to disturb the other guest in their sleep when I came home late. If you are staying in the middle room I can imagine it'd be quite loud as you are subjected to whatever is going on in the living room, and the one night I stayed here there were people in the living room until 12:30 am. If you are ok with all of this, you would probably like this flat. It's well furnished and clean, the communication with Tommy was very easy as well as the check-in process. It depends on what you're looking for in a stay!",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is much smaller than expected and Tom sleeps in the kitchen and plays video games in the living room all day and night. I came in during the day opened my computer to do some work while heating up food. Tom came in after walking the dog and immediately started vacuuming under my chair then in my room. It felt passive aggressive. Then he turned on a skit about Chucky Cheese while I was on the computer and reading while waiting for my food to heat up. The entire apartment is not available. Just your room. He uses the rest of the small kitchen and living room to sleep, play video games, and watch tv. As he walked in while I was reading and on computer he started vacuuming. Then he commented on how the back two legs of my chair were on the wooden floor.",NEGATIVE
"I didn't actually get to stay at Ruben's because I booked the BnB for the same day. I texted him to tell him that I need the place for tonight, in the afternoon. He accepted the request at midnight, after I had already found another place and the night was half gone. In my opinion, when he saw that the booking was for tonight and it's already 11pm, he shouldn't have accepted. He barely knows working English so that made the whole ordeal even more difficult, or perhaps even caused the misunderstanding in the first place. I am sure the BnB is comfortable and Ruben is a polite guy but my experience was bad.",NEGATIVE
"Not many restaurants near the apartment. I had difficulty with the Induction stove, no experience with one. Would have been helpful to have written directions near the stove.",NEGATIVE
"Small flat well situated next to a metro station and a small supermarket. Very quiet area. But be careful to the pictures that seem to show you 2 bedrooms, which is wrong : there is one small real bedroom with a closing door but the second double bed is in the living room, absolutely not in a bedroom ! So if you are 4 people, you shouls rather be very close ! And the bathroom is very tiny, which can make uneasy to shower",NEGATIVE
"Lazy host, no key was left where he said it was, although I had told him I was checking in 3 hours later than expected. Had to wait an hour for the key to then find that the cleaner had not been!",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is spacious enough for 3 adults. But the 3rd sofa bed in the sitting room was not made for the 3rd adult. This was discovered in the evening and we tried calling the given number to try to get the needed sheets. But our several calls went unanswered. So, we send a message which was only answered the next day telling us where to go in the basement to get the needed sheets. We tried but didn't succeed so we tried to make do with what we can. The apartment is cold - heating is poor and the radiators are barely warm. We have to wear layers to stay warm especially at night with socks on to bed! The water pressure for the shower is poor. We even called the host to ask if the water pressure can be improved. Time for the provided towels to be replaced. Overall, should look into improving the above.",NEGATIVE
"Didn’t enjoy our stay here, unfortunately. Couch was disgusting with stains all over it. Host was dismissive when we complained & refused to confirm that it was not caused by ‘bodily fluids’. Neighbours smoked heavily in the hallway for most of our stay & it seeped in through the letterbox (tried to block it using the doormat to limited success). Honestly felt like we were staying in public housing. Would not recommend. Shame because the place has so much potential. It’s spacious, the heated floor in the bathroom is great, and the area is nice with a couple of good supermarkets.",NEGATIVE
"This is a tricky review for me to write. The apartment is clean and bright, located in a quiet neighbourhood close to the green line subway, and it is fairly priced. It has the slightly unlived characteristic of many professional airbnb places, but I don't mind. These were our issues: - The water pressure in the shower is really weak. If you have long hair, rinsing all the shampoo out is a chore. - There are not enough power plugs. Like, there's a disconnected lamp just sitting next to the bed with nowhere to plug it in. - The basement washing machine/dryer felt kind of... dirty. Clothes did not feel fresh afterwards. I would say the place is good for either a really short stay where you dont need to do laundry, or a longer stay where maybe it's worth rectifying some of the issues yourself. The shower water pressure really should be fixed tho. I would feel so much better about recommending this place if it was. There is a surprisingly good cafe near the subway station (very friendly too), and Ålsten nearby has a great gelato place.",NEGATIVE
"The most bad thing regarding this apartment was terrible cold! It was 12 degrees at the apartment. The location is great, apartment is pretty light, but this cold(",NEGATIVE
"A good value for money, for me personally the bed were a little bit hard/uncomfortable and i didnt sleep that well.",NEGATIVE
"The good: - large, recently renovated apartment with lovely kitchen - close to public transport, shops and restaurants - easy to find and only three stairs The bad: - it can be noisy. The bedroom is right by the entry to the apartment block and you hear noise through most of the evening. The neighbour in the apartment above gets up at 7am weekdays, so do you. - the washing machine. The washing machine is not in the apartment so you need to host to book it and tell you where it is. The host did not respond to three of my messages trying to book the machine. She only responded after I had checked out, she did apologise afterwards but I didn’t really help.",NEGATIVE
"It's a great apartment on a really good location. Apartment is very clean as well and we'll equipped. Check in was horrible though. Check in was supposed to happen via an app on your phone via a digital lock, which marina had to send to me. After telling her numerous times I didn't receive it, she seemed not really to care and act if I was stupid. She told me to 'just open the app and keep it in front of the door' since I didn't receive the key she was supposed to send it obviously didn't work.after calling her 7 times and waiting close to an hour without any response I decided to book a hotel for the first night instead. Then marina finally called and tried to send the digital key again, after a couple of tries it worked. She promised me to not charge me for the first night, but I am still waiting for that refund..",NEGATIVE
"Not recommended. The apartment was with less crockeries, not provided with bath towels, shampoos, hand wash . These are the basic things which always should be in place. Other than that too unhygienic. Even we asked for room / air freshener . Crockeries was stinking with strong bad odour . From which my wife fell sick. Even to stay properly we have to clean the place & also cleaned when we left the place.",NEGATIVE
"When we arrived, that was with 30min before the time we sayd to her, she was very cold and replied That is not possible to meet until the time we have sayd. I don't know if she make this with every guest she welcome to her house but maybe it was just because the country we come from, she ask to take a picture to our ID. So, I don't think she is so nice as she try to be during the SMS on the Airbnb.",NEGATIVE
"At ~$300/night, this apartment is NOT cheap! Had it provided proper beds for 4 people, it would be good value given the good location. However, considering that 2 of the ""beds"" were back/neck killers (one tiny leaky air mattress, and one old sagging couch), I would NOT recommend this apartment to any party larger than 2 people.",NEGATIVE
"Pros: Nice location close to city. Big living room and kitchen was nice. Bathrooms were also nice. Free parking very close to apartment. Cons: Smaller bedroom downstairs was not in photos and is unusable - constant noise from boiler, very aggressive smell(aroma) and due to one small window it was not possible to get rid of it. Dirty - dust, spiders,... Forced to use the bedrooms on top floor. (we were group of 4) Missing blinders in windows in bedrooms on the top floor. Whole house is old. Basically everything is squeaky. Doors hard to close/opens. Broken handles for drawers. Dirty equipment in kitchen in drawers between clean ones. Some basic maintenance to get the house to better condition would be nice.",NEGATIVE
"Our arrival was not so pleasant. We found bedlinen and towels from the previous guests still in the washing machine and dryer and wet washed linen and towels were still on top of the dryer. We immediately notified the owner about this and about broken material and asked a question about the use of the extraction hood. On the day of our departure (after 4 nights) we finally got a reply with an excuse about why it had been impossible to get back to us (phone dropped in a lake). Our friendly answer to this reply was never answered back on. This aside, the house itself was to our satisfaction. It is located in a quiet neighbourhood surrounded by nature. In close proximity there is a bus stop which brings you in combination with the metro to the heart of Stockholm in between 30 and 50 minutes, depending on where you want to go. The house is also very unique and with the two terraces very cosy. Light sleepers need to keep in mind that the upstairs bedrooms have got no curtains or shutters.",NEGATIVE
Sofi's apartment is really well located in the heart of Stockholm and it's really cozy and warm. Not perfect things are: just two small towels and not ironed sheets in the bed. I did'nt like at all that the host was completely absebt and there has been no chance to get in touch with her (this is not how we intent an airbnb experience),NEGATIVE
"No hot water when we arrived. The dishwasher had been on and was not emptied. And it was full of dishes and stuff! No coffee, no Wi-Fi, no Netflix as described which didn't help as we checked in on Christmas day. It was not easy for us to get around elsewhere. Sofabed was smaller than other places. The host didn't respond either by Airbnb messages, text messages or phone calls. If you do not want to respond during Christmas, please do not rent it out. Considering the price, this was not worth it. I never wrote a negative Airbnb review before and even hesitated to leave one, but I think later customers can benefit from this information before making their decision. I'm sorry.",NEGATIVE
The Apartment is well located in the heart of old town very close to restaurants shopping and metro. The apartment was clean and the kitchen was well equipped. What was very disappointing is the furniture has been replaced with much less desirable furniture – stained uncomfortable couch - cheap dining room chairs – no microwave. The rug was replaced with a smaller rug and living room light fixture changed out. You will not get the nice furniture as pictured on the website.,NEGATIVE
"Its very near to gamla stam underground (5 min walking). There isnt lift , the room is on the second floor. The drain in the bathroom is backed up, need to clean it, almost overflowed the bathroom. The sofa and the carpet are not the same as the photos. The sofa has a big spot.",NEGATIVE
"Well, I tried to contact the host on the phone, voice message and WhatsApp message as I didn't get the email with instructions for self check-in, she never replied and I was outside, in the street at half past midnight, in the cold and by chance I finally found a room in a hotel that I paid 185€, I was going to sleep in the street !!! As of today, I'm still waiting to hear from Kerstin...",NEGATIVE
"I do NOT recommend this apartment. Unfriendly and rude host. Before my trip I asked if there would be toiletries in the apartment. I was told yes, but there was no shampoo in the apartment. The host did not believe it. I sent a photo of the bathroom's cabinet to prove it, they said they would bring some, but they never showed up and did not even apologise for this. The wardrobe in the bedroom was broken, the mattress was not covered and it was stained, half of the lights in the apartment did not work. Cherry on the cake: guests have to take out the garbage otherwise they get charged. Stay away from this place.",NEGATIVE
"Good place to stay, and a very cosy apartment. Close to many restaurants and cafés and easy access from the metro station. Unfortunately our two last nights came with a lot of noise from the apartment above/close to ours. This was of course not possible for our host to foresee or to fix, but that was really annoying and ruined our sleep. The last night we could only sleep between 04-09 in the morning... Other than that, all good.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment was dirty when we checked in, the sheets and towels. There is no remote to the tv which made it hard to use it and there is a different couch from the pictures and it was impossible to sit comfortable bc the parts of the couch is loss so you can’t lay back. Great location tho, great WiFi.",NEGATIVE
"Pros: bed, tv, location Cons: bad smell in the hallway, leaking toilet, dishwasher out of order, no coffee-maker, shortage of kitchen supplies and towels, no possibility of storing luggage (as was advertised).",NEGATIVE
"Place was amazing and super clean as well as spacious. My only issue was a bit of the communication. The wifi wasn’t working and when I let the guests know they provided me another wifi to use. That didn’t work either and I communicated that to which I got no response. I had to use my data which is expensive considering I’m not from Sweden. Also, I communicated the door couldn’t lock from the inside to which I also received no response- so I didn’t sleep well knowing the door was unlocked. Other than that, the place is beautiful, but I guess I was unlucky with my experience.",NEGATIVE
- overpriced for location,NEGATIVE
"The apartment is wonderfully-located, and in an attractive building. The bed was quite comfortable too. However, the towels provided were musty, leaving an unpleasant smell when drying with them, and only one, nearly-finished toilet roll was left so we had to buy more. Check-in instructions varied for the code to the door between the check-in page, and the message sent, so we had some trouble getting the door unlocked. The bathroom window had no shade and is directly overlooked by a neighbour’s kitchen window, which made for awkward post-shower eye contact. All in all I probably wouldn’t stay there again unless these concerns were fixed.",NEGATIVE
"We booked for 4 people and when we arrived, there was bedding and towels only for 2 people. When we contacted the host, we were told we wouldn’t get additional bedding and towels until the next morning, and the items were not actually brought to us till the afternoon. The apartment also did not match the photos at all. All of the furniture was different, replaced with cheaper, less nice furniture. In the kitchen, the dishwasher was very difficult to start; there was no logic as to how it worked and we essentially had to press various buttons and hope for it to start. The host failed to mention that the entire floor/building except for the apartment is under construction, and we were awoken before 8 in the morning by construction noises in the hallway. The host was also slow to respond and did not make an effort to accommodate our needs.",NEGATIVE
on the negative first the host did not respond in a timely manner if at all first - we had to ask for the passwood after the 4 00 o'clock entrance time before it was sent second - the wifi and cable did not work from the time we entered. we messaged 7 times about the problem and not once in four days did they respond or fix the problem. on the positive- great location and clean,NEGATIVE
"The flat ist very nice. The communication and reliability of agreements were unsatisfactory, though.",NEGATIVE
"Good place, perfect location. Worth the price! Communication was confusing and the towels left an unpleasant stench.",NEGATIVE
"Fine central location. A lot of noise from parties and bars during the night, due to the area. Bed was good, but sofa bed was very bad - would not recommend sleeping on this multiple nights. A very negative experience was that there were no towel and bedding for the third person and no toilet paper. Owner was aware of the third person in the booking, and was not responsive about the missing items after multiple attempts - very bad communication. Additionally, there was no bath mat (super slippery bathroom floor), and no shampoo or coffee as noted in the description. Would not recommend compared to the price",NEGATIVE
"We booked the apartment for three people but when we arrived it had only been set up for two - there were only 2 towels and the sofa bed was not fit for purpose. The host was slow to respond to this issue which meant one of us had to sleep on an unmade sofa on our first night. All had been fixed in time for the second night. The wifi was also unfortunately very patchy. It's a shame because the stay would have otherwise been fantastic - the apartment is in a great location in the centre of the old town, and the check-in and check-out was easy.",NEGATIVE
"Kerstin’s apartment is in a great location. It is light-filled and spacious, and it has a good bathroom and great kitchen. We were disappointed, however, to find that much of the cutlery, the pots and some of the dishes were dirty, even though they were put away in the cupboards. The fridge needed defrosting, one of the lounge room cushions had some dried muck on it, a chair was broken, and the bed and under-sized pillows smelt so strongly of human sweat that my wife felt insulted. The towels were incredibly thin, and the bedding was so old and worn - they should have been replaced long ago. Stefan promptly fixed some of these things when we first raised them, however it needs to be said that this is a lovely apartment that has been spoiled by neglect. A little TLC would make such a difference.",NEGATIVE
"Everything about the place except for check-in was great. We were given multiple codes and addresses. When we tried to call the host, they took 30 minutes to respond and only said to contact via the app only. Unfortunately the app was not working and our only option was to call the contact phone number given. It took an hour to finally enter the apartment.",NEGATIVE
the nice white bright space is not what your going to get. Ironic as it may be Aura says please be quiet after 2200 yet when we returned after a Wedding @ 2330 we were met by upstairs screaming drunks,NEGATIVE
Only one word can describe this place: P E R F E C T,NEGATIVE
"I have lived in Stockholm and used to work on Gamla Stan. Aura's place is situated in a lovely part of the old town and is ideally located for a trip. A nice little one room apartment. Communication before and after booking was rather curt, perhaps something lost in translation, but overall nothing to complain about. Unfortunately my trip ended with a rather distressing confrontation with whomever was coming to clean the apartment, which made me feel unsafe. Communication after this incident was again rather curt, confrontational and unsympathetic. Due to this my trip was refunded in full. I am saddened to have to leave a review like this, hopefully it is a one off case not to be repeated.",NEGATIVE
"Pros: great location, responsive hosts, well stocked. Cons: one of the noisier places we have ever stayed. It was warm so we needed to keep windows open which means you hear everything in the alley. Worse the unit above is also a very large rental (we separate from stayed their with 4-5 families each!). While they did not break noise violations you can hear literally everything they say because the sounds reverberate in the small alley. I mean everything! The only way we could sleep was with a iTune fan noise we put on phone. Maybe it would be quieter on cold days when you don’t need to open windows? (2) the unit lists as a 1BR but in the US this would list as a studio as their is just one open, very small room.",NEGATIVE
"The Airbnb apartment was cozy and the perfect size for two people. It was centrally located in Gamla Stan, with easy access to public transport. There were two downsides: it got very hot at night, so we had to keep the windows open. This helped with the temperature, but there was a lot of noise from the streets. If you are a light sleeper, this might be an issue. The other problem was the bathroom, which started to smell after showering due to a lack of ventilation. We had to keep the bathroom door open to let in air. Overall, it was a suitable apartment for us since we were only staying for one night. The host was quick to respond to our messages.",NEGATIVE
"To start with the positive, the apartment is clean and pleasant. But will I stay there again? That’s a no. We had a few issues as something in the apartment needed urgent fixing, and the host responded after many hours or not at all. The bedroom door won’t close as the lock is jammed so it basically cannot close all the way and stays a little open. The host said he can’t fix it. So, if you are looking for a door separation when traveling with another person, look somewhere else. Don’t expect this host to help or do anything extra for you. For example, I asked him in advance if they could open the sofa bed for us as we checked in at 3 am and were too tired to deal with that. Even gave him a reminder two days ahead. He said ok, but when we arrived the sofa bed was closed. He never even apologized. Another thing to keep in mind that we didn’t know in advance, is that you only get one set of keys which was quite a problem for us. The neighborhood is a nice and quiet residential one. No restaurants or anything really within a reasonable walking distance. There is a near by underground station so I did not mind that so much.",NEGATIVE
"The place itself is fine: well-situated, clean, functional. The host, on the other hand, is kind of strange: excessive, controlling, near-paranoid communications. It begins even before you rent the place, with very specific requirements about photo and government-issued ID. Then long emails before you arrive with overbearing instructions that he wants you to acknowledge. Finally, you have to leave the garbage, sheets, etc. just exactly how he specifies, otherwise a threat to charge you money. None of this ruined our stay, and what's more, the one actual communication that I had with Frederik, about the WiFi password, was perfectly fine. But the other messages were kind of creepy, and might put some people off. But as I said, the place itself is fine.",NEGATIVE
"Apartment location was good but I would not recommend. Our experience was not a good one and we found the host to be very unfriendly and difficult to communicate with regarding several issues with blinds not functioning when we only had about 3 hours of darkness, cigarette butts, refrigerator malfunctioning and insufficient towels for the number of persons. The bar below is very noisy and the stairs can be difficult for some people.",NEGATIVE
"Good location. The space is well designed. It's just that the dishwasher doesn't clean the dishes and the bathroom door leaks. The problem was raised, and it was not well resolved.",NEGATIVE
"I would not rent this apartment again, first of all it is very expensive for such a poorly maintained apartment, terrible conditions, broken bed, old carpets, noisy bathtub, if with the value they charge per week it is not enough to buy new towels it is really frustrating for the guest who rents the apartment. And finally left my iPhone charger forgotten, I let she knew when I made check out, and it was never answered in time and after asking for the third time she said that my charger was not forgotten there. And it’s not true!",NEGATIVE
"Pros: -Location in Gamla Stan being central in the city and walking distance to a lot of bars and restaurants -Spacious apartment with plenty of room -Secure Cons: -Bad smell coming from one of the bathrooms, occasionally the drain in the floor of the bathroom would have sewer water come back up onto the floor, which was unsanitary. This occurred even with little water use. -Generally noisy being above some popular bars in the area -Low quality linens -Hosts used automated messages and were generally unresponsive to simple questions. We would not stay here again, given the choice.",NEGATIVE
Gorgeous large apartment sitting in an incredible location. Unfortunately it is currently sitting with a view of a building site as the Slussen construction continues. We were unable to have the windows open due to constant construction noise. The bathrooms both need TLC. We were unable to use one bathroom due to flooding and therefore unable to use the washing machine too! This could be an amazing Airbnb but can see the management team are paying very little attention to detail.,NEGATIVE
"A great location and a very spacious apartment. What we didn't expect was the amount of stairs we had to get up to get to the apartment. This made it very difficult to access as we had a lot of heavy suitcases with us. Other things to be aware of is that there is a lot of noise coming from the construction work outside and the bar right beneath the house plays loud music until 3 am. Some other recommendations for the host would be to advise guests beforehand that you are not allowed to flush toilet paper in the toilet. The pillows and bedlinen could also do with an upgrade. Other than that, it was a really lovely place that was perfect for our family. The hosts were kind enough to let us check out late so we could go straight to the airport.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment was very nice, clean and well located. Everything fine … but somehow the owner didn’t make us feel welcome, in fact I felt very much kick out … sweet and bitter experience I would say!",NEGATIVE
"Unfortunately we cannot recommend the apartment if you really need to sleep before 3 am. The apartment is very spacious and in an excellent location, but there is a very noisy nightclub / bar downstairs which plays music so loud outside at the terrace until 3 am that you can hear all the lyrics. We were staying from Friday until Sunday and during the first night the noise was bearable. However, on Saturday night the noise was two times louder which prevented us from sleeping especially in the bedroom on the street side (even with ear plugs). Even if it was said in the apartment description that there can be noise, we really did not expect that the music is played outside and that therefore the noise would be so disturbing. Note that the club seems to be open every day until 3 am. Otherwise, the bathrooms have some issues (mold in the shower, paper cannot be flushed down the toilets and bad odour), but that didn’t really bother us. Without the noise, a great apartment.",NEGATIVE
"They notified 15 min before checkin problem with one of bathrooms so we could only use the small toilet. Not great for a large family. They wrote plumber would come same afternoon but after that all communication stopped and never responded to our questions on when they would come and fix the problem. No reimbursement for the last minute change, the smell from broken bathroom and most frustrating no communication except auto-emails about check-out. Much older furnitures than pictures. Great location and large apartment and had everything we needed except the 2nd bathroom.",NEGATIVE
"The check in time is after 1600 which is late and by the time we arrived it was dark. The entrance is surrounded by bars and restaurants and not easy to locate and the instructions weren’t as clear. There are also 3 sets of doors and multiple codes and we had issues with the main door opening when we first arrived, also multiple staircases which are slippery when wet with snow. The main bathroom was out of order which we weren’t informed of or updated about at any time and the second bathroom is much smaller. The location is the the only pro, it’s central and walking distance to a metro location and plenty of great restaurants, but there was so much noise coming from the bars downstairs and also next door through the walls until almost 2am.",NEGATIVE
"Good central location. Close to different restaurant and bars. Spacious apartment, nice layout. Lots of natural light. Plenty of space for six people. Toilet leaked continuously and hosts were unresponsive, I can also see from the reviews that this has been a reoccurring issue. We ended up having to just use the one toilet between the six of us. Shower head above bath did not work, again host did not respond to this. Pillows seemed to be old, only one per bed, not very comfortable. No additional pillows available. One towel per person, ideally would’ve liked more. Worth noting that nightclub is below the apartment and you can hear the music well into the night/early morning from some of the bedrooms. Photos are slightly misleading as looks better in the photos. Some items pictured in the photos weren’t in the apartment. Apartment was generally just a bit dated and needed some tlc. Based on the above, we would not stay again.",NEGATIVE
"Sadly the apartment photos do not match reality. 1 bathroom out of order, 1 broken sofa, table top old and missing part, not enough towels for 4. Furniture and rugs in photos not in apartment. this apartment needs some care and attention to bring back to the quality of photos. we were disappointed that we were not notified of 1 bathroom being out of order (for a long time) as that was the main reason we choose it to have 2 bathrooms.",NEGATIVE
Good location but just one bathroom and a half time working WiFi. Host not very welcoming.,NEGATIVE
"This apartment is not as advertised. No way can it accommodate 7 people, photos are not of the apartment and it is way back behind smelly restaurants and up heaps of stairs. “Manager” when contact was arrogant and clearly too busy to discuss the state and size of the accommodation despite the misleading advertising. The only positive is the location.",NEGATIVE
Ugly building. Misleadingly represented. Unwelcoming host that cares more about getting good feedback that making you feel at home. They even have a letter for display explaining you how to rate them (this is so narcissistic and condescending that upset me). No interest on us prior to arrival so the house was inappropriately prepared for our group. He turned rude on a slight misunderstanding involving use of two pillows without covers (they were nowhere to be found). Steep stairs to access the building and even more steep stairs to access the second bedroom. The 4 bedded sofa is a back destroyer. The shower is at the same level as the rest of the toilet and water leaks out. Wardrobes full with bags and clutter. I hope others have a better experience because we didn't.,NEGATIVE
Great central place as advertised. Clean and spacious. Three things worth mentioning for improvement. Only three thin towels between 2 people for 5 days was not enough. Would be nice to have more. The main bedroom bed is extremely soft. And I would not recommend for anyone with back issues. More than half of the lights didn’t work. Light bulbs need to be changed.,NEGATIVE
"The apartment was exactly as it was shown on the pictures! It was super comfy and cozy; we had everything we needed and it was situated in a calm neighbourhood. The subway station was at walking distance (10 minutes more or less) and there was even a grocery store nearby. The only issue I found was that there were too many spiders in the house, but that's just my personal dislike (I am not fond of spiders at all) and it did not make the experience of staying at Dennis's home any worse. If you are looking for a calm and cozy place to stay at while you are visiting Stockholm, this is the house!",NEGATIVE
"I came to Sweden with my parents for traveling. We love the city, however, the living experience was really disappointing. The apartment is really far away from the city center, so we have to pay for metro come and back every day which is a lot. Also, the apartment is kinda far from the metro station with uphills which is not really good for elders. When we enter into the apartment, it’s very hot and with very basic equipments. So if ur here just for travel quickly, then it might be ok. However, if you want to enjoy life, feel like a home, then it’s definitely NOT. Every morning around 3:30am, the sun rises and the curtains are worse than useless, it’s really bright, so we were not able to sleep. Also, the WiFi signal was really really poor and unstable. Anyway, I think if we come to Stockholm again, we will definitely book a place in the city center, the price is not much difference, and it would be much easier.",NEGATIVE
"Host was living right next door, so it would have been a great idea for him to let us know what code to buzz for him to come out and let us in. We only had his phone number so we tried a few sms msgs to which he did not respond. It was raining heavily and we were very tired after driving all day so this was a bit of an inconvenience. At departure time again, we tried by sms to get the host to come for the key as the slot in the door was not accessible, but he didn't respond until we finally decided to knock on his door, which he had not advised us to do. The studio had everything for our needs, but it was very crammed (the bookcase in the picture, even the window sill were really full of objects, and to sit at the table for breakfast one needs to remove the lower coffee table otherwise there is no room for 2 chairs at the two ends. The problem is there is no room where to move that coffee table either! Unless you are willing to fold and unfold the sofa bed twice a day. We made do with all the little inconveniences and enjoyed our stay as much as we could especially as we had a microwave and a toaster, that came in very handy! Otherwise the location was very nice and not too far from the city center - but it is also not very near (at the very best 20 mins by car). Parking is indeed available but it's not free, you pay quite a bit, by the hour, and need to be very careful not to get fined. Also, parking in the city is VERY expensive. Jean Philippe was overall a nice host and gave us some valuable advise.",NEGATIVE
"Gunnar’s place is in a great location, right near talkrogen station so easy to get into the city or Södermalm. The place has it’s own entrance and a shared bathroom, however the reality is you are in the basement of their house and it does really feel like it. The place was rather damp and very dark, I think the photos are a little outdated. The kitchen is certainly not as nice as the photos and I was expecting it to be a little bigger, it only has a microwave and 2 hobs do you can only cook basic meals, anything else is a struggle. I think this place could be really lovely with a little TLC, perhaps some mirrors to reflect the light and a lick of paint. Overall pretty good value for money but would say it needs some love for me to recommend.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is disappointing. It just one room without any windows, a bed for two, a sink and a small table. There is also a supersmall kitchen where you will barely be able to cook pasta. The bathroom is shared with the family and there is no tv or anywhere to stay in the apartmanet apart from your bed. If you rent for more than two people, they will have to sleep in a separate bedroom in a bank, but the landlord literally said ""this is really just for two people"" when we already paid for three. If you are looking for the cheapest apartment ever that can be a solution, but don't plan to stay more than 1h after sleeping because it's small, and there is nothing to do.",NEGATIVE
Location is perfect and Maja seems to be a very nice/responsive host. All in all the appartement is fine but we were disappointed by a couple of things: i) all the windows and balcony were closed to us when we arrived so we had to use a screwdriver to open them; ii) the stores didn’t close so we got awoken by the sun every morning; iii) there were constructions in front of our windows so starting 7am there was a lot of noise; iv) the mattress and especially the sheets in the living room had stains and would need to be changed,NEGATIVE
"Beware! The bed is NOT a queen, much smaller, and it's raised. So safely getting out of bed to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night while trying to not wake your partner is very precarious! The couch does not turn into a bed either. You can sleep 1 comfortably, 2 maybe but we didn't sleep well, but definitely not 4! There is hardly any privacy because there are no curtains so you're completely exposed unless you go to the bathroom to change each time. Otherwise, the location is ideal and good communication with host.",NEGATIVE
"The airbnb is located in the heart of Södermalm. Our stay was alright but the building was under construction (outside wall and windows). It was dirty from the construction site and smelled intensely. The host should have told us about the construction site beforehand when I booked and he should have offered a discount. The smell of new paint was quite intense. Also, the apartment did not have a welcoming atmosphere due to the fact that we didn't see out of the windows and thus didn't have any natural light.",NEGATIVE
"My sister and I stayed here for four nights on our first trip to Stockholm. We would not recommend this accommodation to anyone. The room was not clean. The towels were old and stained, there was a pile of crumbs under one of the beds, and everything felt dirty. We didn’t even feel comfortable having bare feet in the room. The bedding was very minimal (one small lumpy pillow per person and a very very thing duvet), and the heating was not adequate. Everything felt grimy and dirty. There was also no lock on our window and as we were on the ground floor we were concerned about safety. This is not worth the price. We felt so uncomfortable in the room that we barely slept at night.",NEGATIVE
The place is really in the center. However​ old town road is really really difficult to move luggage.,NEGATIVE
Check-in is STRICTLY 5pm - unless you want to pay 500SEK. Makes for a long day of traveling and more expenses to store bags for the day not being able to check in earlier. You are not allowed to use the oven and the bathroom is extremely small which makes it almost unusable. Location is EXCELLENT though.,NEGATIVE
Cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired.,NEGATIVE
It was a very beautiful place and perfectly located in the city center! Unfortunately the check in was at 5 pm which is very late for Airbnb check ins. This was explained to us due to cleaning but when we arrived the cutlery was super dirty. Also the communication was a little weird since we always got told that if we do something wrong we will get charged for it which made the communication unpleasant. But if you look for a place in the city center and do not have the intention to cook there I would recommend staying there with knowing that the communication is very different to most Airbnb hosts.,NEGATIVE
"The location was exceptional and apartment beautiful. However, the experience itself felt as if I was about to sign a business contract, instead of feeling welcomed to a cozy home. When I booked, I received a rather long list of restrictions, additional fee, lack of flexibility note (highlighting no changes to itinerary allowed even for travel restrictions, personal or public reasons (!), and way too many penalty costs which made me feel incredibly heavy. I did not appreciate the the 5pm check in policy (!). An earlier check in from 12-5pm was tied to a 45€ fee, which in my view, it goes against the hospitality minimum standards and even felt abusive. I’m a host myself, and understand the need of clarity and rules, but I always prefer Airbnb over hotels, mainly due to the overall experience. This one felt a bit too much.",NEGATIVE
"Apartment is beautiful and definitely larger than the photos seem. It is also well located and walking distance to everything you could need. There is a taxi stand and a metro stop just outside the front steps. However, the area is very noisy at all hours due to the bars beneath. There is no elevator and you have to carry your luggage up three flights of winding stairs. Definitely not handicap accessible. And the host is not particularly responsive/helpful if there are issues.",NEGATIVE
"If u have heavy luggage, pls avoid to stay here, is a nightmare to carry them and climb the staircases. Host is not responsive to my messages, tv shows no signal, the light in de kitchen is not functioning.",NEGATIVE
"A great location with everything close by, but check-in was confusing, there are LOTS of stairs (fine if you don't have a suitcase AND pram), the communication was poor and the place is a little more tired, dated and in need of repair than it appears in the photos. There was a horrid drain smell throughout the flat the whole time, which made us want to spend as little time as possible in the flat. Having said all this, we didn't notice that much street noise as mentioned in other reviews, the kitchen space is great and the layout was brilliant for us - traveling as a family of three (two adults and a baby).",NEGATIVE
"Quite good, but the locationis difficult to find and it is hard to go up 4 floor stairs with heavy luggage. The bathroom is quite smelly as well.",NEGATIVE
"Booked this place last minute, it was a very nice place but the check in was a nightmare. The code was not being sent to us in order to access the unit, even when we got access we couldn't leave the unit because there was no way for us to lock it. For the amount we paid for a nights stay in the place, was extremely disappointed that the host took a few hours to even respond with a ""I will try and send the code again"". We only got the code the morning of checkout.",NEGATIVE
Good apartment and exactly like photos. The kitchen was't really clean. Also I think that to ask your guests to get the trash out in the end of the stay it's not really nice. If we are leaving the apartment after that the person that clean's the apartment will do that.,NEGATIVE
"The appartement is great and well equipped. But we chose it because the reviews said it was super quiet but we were distributed by a lot of noises during all the nights from neighbors. You can't imagine how annoying it is to be waken up by some Arabic musics at 7am, hearing the steps from the upper appartement, hearing people shouting in the outside stairs after their party at 4am... I don't know maybe we got unlucky. And I received the check out instructions at 9am the last day but we were already gone at 5am.",NEGATIVE
"You are at the very centre of town: 180 m from a bridge that all but two of Stockholm's subway lines cross, 50 m from the biggest construction site in Scandinavia, and 0 m from a party zone. The bottle truck comes by every morning at 5:30. Because of the construction, you have to walk a bit of a detour to get to Södermalm, the cool part of town. The apartment is a bit run down. The table lamp has no shade and no bulb, door handles are falling out of their sockets, an arm chair is a piece of rubbish, 2 out of 6 kitchen counter lights are working, oven and dishwasher are falling out of their enclosures, etc. The fans in both the bathroom and the kitchen are always on, because of a bit of a smell. The kitchen equipment is very bare bones. On the plus side, the apartment is bright, when the weather is sunny, and the shower has plenty of sufficiently hot water. The communication with the hosts is a bit hit and miss. About half our inquiries were left unanswered.",NEGATIVE
"The location was perfect and the apartment was lovely. The communication however, very poor. I found Kerstin extremely rude and unaccommodating. I specifically booked this for 3 people and she didn’t bother to leave 3 towels, only 2. She also didn’t bother to leave any bedding/pillows/blankets etc for the sofa bed. There was no essentials in the apartment for us ie. tea or coffee etc. Also only 1 half-used roll of toilet paper. The apartment felt clean however there was a strange ‘off’ lingering smell in the bathroom. It wasn’t terrible but I definitely wouldn’t recommend unless you only primarily need something right in the city and within walking distance.",NEGATIVE
"This was absolutely the worst experience on Airbnb, and I have traveled to many different places around the world. Upon arrival to Stockholm, I asked if we could check-in a bit early just to drop off our bags since our train arrived at around 11:00 AM. The check-in was at 4:00 PM, however I was told via A long auto text that came within seconds of me sending my request. We could not enter due to “cleaning”. I am not sure what cleaning takes five hours as the checkout time is at 11:00 AM for previous guests, but I left it at that and checked our bags into the Central Station for five hours which was extremely expensive and had to roam around in the heat until check-in time at 4:00 PM. When it was finally time to check-in at 4:00 PM, I was trying to get into the building, however the host made it extremely impossible for me as she was not picking up the phone when I had questions about the key-pad in the check-in process. There are three different codes that need to be entered at three different doors, however the host(s) did not reply to any calls, just texts that were confusing because they were coming from three separate people (co-hosts). Seemed a bit shady to be honest. We entered the apartment about 40 minutes late due to the check-in complications and there had not been that much cleaning considering there was a five hour cleaning time-gap. In the bedroom they only gave us one set of linens and one towel each and the wardrobe was unkept with old sheets not washed nor folded, as if someone just tossed them in there haphazardly. In addition, the curtain rods fell very easily from the lack of proper installation. The pots and pans in the kitchen were still stained with oil from previous guests which we had to rewash ourselves. The bathroom had no complimentary hygienic products whatsoever, just old used stuff from previous guests stuffed into the mirror cabinets. Thank goodness we brought our own bar of soap. The host should mention in their ad that there is heavy construction in the location just outside of the building which starts early morning and continues for the rest of the day on weekdays. There is also a club just downstairs which plays heavy music that rocks the walls and makes it impossible to sleep during the weekends. Transparency regarding this matter would have been much appreciated. As previously mentioned, the checkout time is at 11:00 AM, and someone knocked on our door at 10:59 AM am on the dot telling us it is check-out time. What kind of host would do that? Where was this punctual enthusiasm when we were trying to check-in? In particular because we lost 40 minutes just trying to get into the building for check-in to begin with. We had to rush out of the Airbnb when checking out and once again spent money on lockers at the Central Station until our train arrived later that day. It is such a shame that a beautiful early century home such as this is not well taken care of by the hosts. Do yourselves a favor and search elsewhere until the above stated improves.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment was clean, spacious, and has a comfortable bed. The location was right in the old city - walkable to everywhere. The WiFi that was given on the instructions was not found so we could not connect to WiFi the entire time, which was very inconvenient. I texted the host but did not receive a response. The bathroom fan ran continuously and was very loud; there was no switch to shut it off. We asked for additional towels, but they were not delivered. The house rules posted and sent by the host were terse and unwelcoming. We will not stay at this apartment next time.",NEGATIVE
overall it's good. Digital lock is not working so took some time to check-in. heater in the bedroom is also not working so well,NEGATIVE
"An annoyance to get inside, requiring dozens of different codes. Rude instructions that are transmitted completely automated. Host sends advertisements for some restaurants or whatever to squeeze some more money through advertising. The place is very obviously one of these gentrification driving ones only rented to be put on Airbnb -everything wrong with the platform summarised in one mediocre stay for me. Otherwise it was an okay, fairly clean stay. Messy wiring everywhere though, loose kitchen appliances, general rude host attitude.",NEGATIVE
"Cozy apartment with everything you need. All major attractions are within walking distance. Unfortunately, it is located directly above the bar, it is noisy at night and the front door stinks very much!",NEGATIVE
"The unit was clean, safe, and centrally located. The host wasn’t responsive or empathetic. Our flight was delayed 4 hours in London so we arrived very late, but still within our checkin window of 4pm to 2am. The keyless code we were given didn’t work and the host didn’t respond to messages or calls. Airbnb customer support couldn’t reach them either. NONE of the hotels in the area had availability so we ended up having to take another Uber to a hotel out of town. We finally laid down at 5am and when I checked messages at noon, the host still hadn’t responded. After messaging again they responded with “you were late checking in” and a new key code. On arrival a handyman showed up to change the toilet seat, which we weren’t informed of. There was a construction ladder blocking the kitchen door, the oven wasn’t bolted to the cabinet so it slid, and the freezer was iced over so the door wouldn’t close properly. Lots of little things adding up to a place we wouldn’t stay at again.",NEGATIVE
"No garbage can, and ask me to bring my garbage out, it’s so ridiculous!! Just place is good",NEGATIVE
"The apartment located in a central area at the old town Stockholm with a lot of restaurant and close supermarket, there is three code locks to enter the apartment and the host tell us wrong two of theme, so we were struggle to enter and it took a lot of time.",NEGATIVE
"The location was perfect! Excellent for metro and old town. Central to restaurants and city centre, ferry etc. All things in walking distance. The apartment is very tired and windows/frames/cupboard/freezer needs repair so not exactly like pictures! It is also extremely noisy with rubbish collection from about 5/5.30 am every morning. I went to buy ear plugs but they didn’t help 😣",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is in a good location and very central. Unfortunately, like many other reviews it is clear that this place needs a refresh. The most important thing in any accommodation booking is the bed and it is pretty uncomfortable. The pillows and quilt are soft and lifeless and need to be replaced. So I think that fixing the bedding arrangements would be a good place to start. Towels are undersupplied as well. Communication from the host is lacking as there was an unexpected visit from the handyman one day. When renting an apartment you expect privacy - or at least notice if a handyman or tradesperson is to arrive well in advance of them being at the front door. Having to take your own rubbish out upon check out is also a little cheeky considering that is in the fees you pay for cleaning. All in all this is not somewhere I would stay again - the hosts need to raise their game and improve the communication and refresh the apartment.",NEGATIVE
This is a place the host lives in and ALL their stuff is still there. It was very unpleasant. I’ve never stayed in an Airbnb that wasn’t just for rental and I will be very wary to ever use Airbnb again. There was a bath but no bath plug so I bought one but the water just drains out all over the floor. The balcony is good and the small beach very close by but the place as a whole I would not recommend. We were very disappointed.,NEGATIVE
Its the great location in Gamla stan that’s why the price is expensive. Double bed mattress was so soft that our body just sink in it. That’s why we put our 2 years old son on that and sleep on Sofa bed. Which was not that comfy to. Fridge doors were cover with dirty hands marks plus there was some rubbish under the rug to. When we checked in and open the bathroom door drains were stinking. And I would not suggest anyone do any cooking there because smell Will not go away. Overall I will say our stay was ok but Apartment have great location.,NEGATIVE
"The apartman is in a perfect location, but it was not very soundproof. The street noise was very audible. It was not the cleaniest and the bathroom was smelly. Anyway, almost every must see attraction is in walking distance.",NEGATIVE
"We loved this place. We were interested in the historic city, not the shopping district, or other parts. It is a 20-25 minute walk from the train station (maps says 15 min - that’s a lie). Charlotta’s directions were clear. The apartment is small, but well furnished (lots of IKEA). We have three gripes: 1) The TV didn’t work. 2) There were not outlets on both sides of the bed. There should be a way for both people to charge their phones next to the bed. 3) There is no place to put luggage. This is a personal pet peeve — nobody seems to recognize that travelers have luggage. So your bags end up on the table or the kitchen counter or the couch or in the middle of the floor. But, that said, we could not have been happier! (And the building was part of our old town walking tour — look for he phoenix symbol on the wall.)",NEGATIVE
"When we arrived at the apartment we were shocked at the level of cleanliness. I informed the owner that we were very disappointed with the accommodation. The apartment to say the least was not clean. There was a used frying pan left in the oven, a bag of re-cycle left under the sink and a pile of dishes including the kettle left in the dish rack. There also appeared to be what was a basket full of laundry. We were unable to empty our suitcases as there were no empty drawers or shelves left for guests. All of the storage spaces were crammed full. We were only able to hang some of our clothes on the coat rail in the hall. The rest of our belongings, and we were there for six nights, we had to keep in our suitcases. Now we come to the most important and disturbing point which we feel obliged to post. Never at anytime has my wife and myself slept in a bed which can only be described as filthy. When we pulled back the the sheet which had been left on the bed we were appalled to see that there stains all over the mattress. We thought we better check the pillows and doing so found they too were badly stained. This is not acceptable. Had we not been fortunate to have family living nearby who brought us clean bed linen, pillows, pillow slips and towels, we would have had to find alternative accommodation. It is quite apparent that the photographs posted on the AirBnB site have been cleverly taken to show the apartment in a good light and it is quite a surprise when you walk in through the front door. It is simply not what one expects. One of the photographs posted even shows a television fitted to the wall. We can confirm that there was no television as it had obviously been removed with only the holes in the wall left !!!!! On a positive note, it is in a good location. The bathroom is well decorated ( apart from very worn and dirty floor mats - we just put a towel down on the floor ) with a good shower. Lights in the vanity unit need replacing. To our dismay, whilst out walking we came across the Courtyard by Marriott Hotel located on Ralambshovsleden 50 and on speaking with them we found out to our dismay that we could have stayed there for our six nights for less than we paid for the apartment. We would have had a clean room, a clean bed, wifi, TV and all the other facilities of the hotel. The hotel stay would also have included breakfast for both of us. We know what to do on our next visit. This was not our first time to use AirBnB, having used it in Spain and also previously in Stockholm. Our other experiences were excellent and were recorded as such. My recommendation",NEGATIVE
"I would not recommend staying here, this has been my worst AirBnB experience since starting to use it in 2017. I'll just list the issues: - I guess first off I should mention that due to Daniel's negligence, the apartment was broken into and my stuff was stolen. - When we arrived there was no toilet paper. - From our initial arrival, the toilet kept getting clogged, Daniel claimed that this had never happened before, despite it happening from the very beginning of our stay. We had to buy our own plunger to clear out the toilet and it was constantly getting clogged (every second to third day). - Kitchen was dirty, cutlery and pots were dirty and greasy. - Bathroom was dark, of the 9 lights in the bathroom, 2 were working. I'm not sure if Daniel knows how to change a lightbulb. - Things were just crammed into all of the cupboards to the point where some stuff started falling out when opening them. - After the laundry key was taken in the robbery, Daniel did nothing to get another one for us. The robbery happened on the 2nd of November and nothing was done in that time. - There was construction work being done directly outside of the apartment which we only found out about the day we arrived. About the burglary: When arriving at the apartment, I questioned Daniel about the external door locking as I could not get the handle to come down completely to close and lock it. He told me it was fine, that I should just push it down as far as I can and that you can't get in from the outside. Unsurprisingly, while I was at work, someone broke into the apartment through this door, seeing as you can see that the door handle isn't closed properly from the outside. They stole about $1400 worth of goods from me, including my ID, Passport and Drivers Licence. When confronting Daniel, he took absolutely no responsibility for this, despite me actively asking him about the door not locking. The apartment looks nothing like in the photos, the furniture is different, the walls are marked and dirty, the lighting is bad, it just feels dark and dingy I didn't use the kitchen at all because it was gross. I spent almost no time in the apartment. I'm sure Daniel will say that I was hostile towards him after the robbery, and, yes, I was, because it was through his negligence and blowing me off when I asked about the door not locking, he refused to take any responsibility and just told me that it had never happened before. 0/10 would not recommend.",NEGATIVE
I would not stay here again. The neighborhood does not feel safe and I would not want to be there by myself at night. The neighbors seemed scared to open there doors and would not help me. The host was not good at communicating and would not tell me what apartment she lived in. She did not understand that I didn't have cell service so I couldn't call her.,NEGATIVE
"The apartment is very clear. The kitchen is fully equipted for cooking. Just bed is too small and is not very comfortable for 2 people, which sleep there more than one night.",NEGATIVE
It’s a terrible experience. The host charges unreasonable fees and imposed untruth,NEGATIVE
"Shoddy Kitchen materials, creepy surveillance cameras, abrasive communication and price gouging, oh my! Some hosts feel grateful you chose them. Others feel you should be grateful they allow you in the door. William is the latter. From the start he communicates in a way intended to establish control and a sense that he is smarter than you and watching your every move. Nice! You will be greeted with a camera recording everything, so you are certain to never feel ease. William does not want you to relax and be in ease. He will control your temperature (literally controlling the temperature of the building) and inundate you with rules and abrasive language. The space functions in a basic way, but has no sense of care. It is that feeling of get the money and get them out of here. The kitchen pans are torn apart and unusable as well as unsafe. I mentioned this to William and he flat ignored it. Thanks for the feedback. Only once before in 6 years has a host failed to make some effort to correct a mistake or fix a problem. I have learned to trust airbnb because of that and alas, William does not fit that bill. What he will do is incessantly request that you give a 5 star review. The pressure is very intense and unbecoming. That same energy put into the care of the property would easily support the outcome he desires. Before using the kitchen and noticing the torn up teflon pans, I asked about an extension. The space is central and the price was good for a solo traveler. I have a screenshot of the price before I asked. He then manually increased the price and asked me to pay in case in person. I do not trust those who betray the ones who are helping their business. Think what you want of airbnb, they provide a service we are using for good reason and that he would ask me to go outside of their policies is a clear indicator I do not wish anything to do with this person. After I declined, the price collapsed confirming it was an attempt to take advantage of a situation versus actual pricing based on location/time of year. So to summarize, I shared that I could not use the kitchen I paid for and he shrugged his shoulders. I inquired about an extension and he raised the rates and asked me to pay outside of airbnb. Then multiple requests for a 5 star rating. This is William. He wants you to do what he wants and be grateful for the privilege of serving him. Don't be like William.",NEGATIVE
"Great location. If you a large group, the dwelling only has one toilet in the shower room...get in line. Similarly, the kitchen is not really suitable to.prepare a full meal. No large pan or stainer. Furniture is 90% ikea which does not allow much personality, but Ikea is Swedish after all. overall slightly overpriced.",NEGATIVE
"Overall, a fair Airbnb with issues and as such We don’t believe it’s worth the money. A few points below: - Multiple rules to follow in the apartment, however the place was ready at 4pm, not the scheduled time 3pm as stated in his rule book. - Bathroom was below par, with a dirty shower curtain and flooded easily. - Wifi was weak throughout the apartment, continually dropping off and didn’t work in the living room. When the issue was raised, owner provided guidance to fix the wifi but did not fix it himself. - I would note, there is also a CCTV camera on the door to monitor guests (i.e. to tracks guests above the 3 confirmed). I believe this is unethical to include a camera in a flat without prior consent of the guest.",NEGATIVE
Unbelievable value and location. You could sleep a whole extended family here and not feel crowded.,NEGATIVE
"Nice flat, nice area, about 30 min walking to Gamlastan. But inflatable bed is absolutely not a good place to rest, my back was not happy in the morning.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment’s location is okay but not so great either depending on what you’re looking for. There is a street with some restaurants and bars not far away but those were not the best in my opinion. Also the apartment is not bad but I’ve found it very narrow. the tiny bathroom was not comfortable to use, knowing that the only mirror is above the toilets (which I couldn’t use standing up properly). Aside from this, Stellan is a cool host, who shared a list of bars and restaurants to go to in the neighborhood.",NEGATIVE
If you like ‘shabby chic’ then you’ll be alright here. The furniture is very worn (couch had rips at seams). You need to climb a small ladder to get onto the bed. The bath towels were thin and worn. Bring your own. Dingy shower. No towel or soap in the toilet area. I am 5’5 145 lbs and I could only get in the toilet area with the door open and my knees were up against the plumbing pipe under the sink while I sat on the toilet. There is an elevator but you have to climb a set of stairs to get to it. I couldn’t cook there. The kitchen is tiny and it can hardly fit one person. The stove is more like a hot plate. We ate out. But it is quiet and had a nice park adjacent to it. Realistically it’s more for one person -not two. There was no storage for a suitcase. It’s more of a place for a one night layover. We left early and quietly. We didn’t want to complain. Very awkward.,NEGATIVE
very confortable,NEGATIVE
They had rules not to shower after 21.00 and no telephone use after 21.00 which I only came to know when I reached. Of course it’s their home they can have their own rules but they should put those in the listing so that people can know what they are agreeing to.I was on a call and trust me I was not speaking loud.the owner knocks 3 times on my door and shouted ‘no telephone’ I was so scared knowing the door has no lock and it was hard to sleep after that.,NEGATIVE
"Mimmi seems like a well-meaning person, but was not prepared to host on this day. There were communication issues which led to being locked outside the apartment at night. Room was not ready when I arrived, and generally not very clean.",NEGATIVE
"I travelled with 3 friends for 7-night stay and had a very disappointing experience: -Lack of basic amenities: Upon arrival, we discovered the host did not provide toilet paper. We contacted the host and were told that this is a private villa, not a hotel. Hence no toilet paper will be provided. We found this unacceptable as this is basic necessity. - Poorly maintained facilities: The 2nd toilet was unusable with no proper shower head and extremely dim light in the basement, even in day time. The faulty stair handrail is a safety hazard when anyone taking the stairs, especially when we have elderly guests. No wardrobe space for guests as everywhere is still stuffed with the owners’ clothes. - The presence of multiple cameras inside the house is an intrusion of privacy and not what we expect in a private rental. When we tried to communicate to the host, she was unhelpful and hostile. Overall, this stay did not meet our expectation and we will not recommend to others.",NEGATIVE
The Check-Inn was very easy. Unfortunately the room was not very clean so we didn’t feel comfortable.,NEGATIVE
"Nice location, but it was not what we thought it would be, the bed is two twin beds put together, The TV you have to unplug to shut off, the safe doesn’t work, toilet seat be careful very lose, carpet through out the place and a fan of carpet , one flight of stairs with carpet be careful going up, the hallway light shuts off in 5 seconds so bring a flash light so you can see the key pad, when you sit on toilet your knees will be under sink, The owner is very hard to reach only through Airbnb. The Room is out of the main town but walking distance to the palace about two miles The Best part of the room is you got a Great pub across the street and Meatball restaurant you need to try , Remember no drinking alcohol in the room so me and my wife could not have a bottle of wine. It’s getting warm and no AC , the number 4 stop on the hop on hop off drops you off right near the place and starts running at 10:00 Enjoy",NEGATIVE
"Nice apartment located in the old town of Stockholm. Easy to check in and check out. The only negative point of this apartment is that you could not close the front door of the apartment which, despite having access code to the building, caused us some insecurity.",NEGATIVE
"Location and charm of the apartment is great, however a bit noisy at night but that was expected. Sadly host did not respond to a serious issue with the windows not being able to secure closed, meaning our child could have easily leant our and fallen out (as you can sit in the deep windowsills) I had to tie them together with tooth floss!! As it’s in fact on the fourth floor (NOT first) this is really dangerous and also makes it more noisy than it needs to be. Probably not the most suitable apartment if you have kids, the stairs are steep and many, with several doors and locks etc to go through.",NEGATIVE
"Great location, beautiful house. However, disappointing that Familjen didn’t reply to me when I asked about the wifi code (was very quick responding regarding payment & check out).",NEGATIVE
"The idea of the apartment was good. However, it did forget to mention that there are many many many stairs which we struggled to get up with our pushchair. Next the bathroom kept flooding at the slightest drop of water so we were unable to shower or bath the baby. The handy man did turn up but the leaking got considerably worse afterwards. The host did not respond to further messages. Just to note, on arrival there were no bed sheets or pillow cases for one of the beds. Other than that, the area was lovely. It was in old town which is lovely to just stroll around and close to the ferry to other parts.",NEGATIVE
not worth,NEGATIVE
"I gave 3 stars because of responsive host and the location was great, but the entire building smelled of ammonia. Cleaning wasn't finished in time for check-in, so we had to wait at the door for 10 mins. Even though we arrived 30 minutes after the check-in time, the cleaning lady was very unfriendly when we arrived, as if she had seen an unexpected guest. She had her earphones in her ears and gave us no explanation or greeting as she left.",NEGATIVE
"The location was fabulous for getting around Stockholm. However, the pictures are not an accurate representation of the apartment. Few of the furnishings in the pictures are actually there. The furniture that is there is in desperate need of repair. The washer works but the dryer does not. The washer is almost impossible to load because it opens directly into the toilet. You can't open the microwave door easily because the cabinet above it is too low. This unit is 97 stairs up and there isn't an elevator so moving luggage is an issue. There was only 1 kitchen towel, no paper towels, 2 rolls of toilet paper for a weeks stay. The floors and the doors are extremely squeaky so it makes sleeping difficult if someone is walking around or opening/closing doors. The floor is very soft in places. Few smoke detectors. Only 2 of 5 lights in the bathroom work. Overall we were disappointed with the apartment. The majority of the problems could be remedied if someone cared enough to do so.",NEGATIVE
"Pro - The location is great, in the middle of Old Town and just around the corner from the Royal Castle, also close to the Metro and ferry services for when you want to check out things outside Old Town. Con - The bedroom is in need of light-blocking blinds or drapes, it was very bright throughout the night. - The beds are not great. It was difficult to get enough sleep. The main bed was uncomfortable. The spare option is a folding cot which was also uncomfortable and not much wider than a man's shoulders.",NEGATIVE
"Place was very clean , but cold with no direct sunlight. Lighting poor, Window coverings poor. No toaster. Location requires a lot of walking to transport and shopping.",NEGATIVE
"It's an expensive small, dark and very humid apartment. Windows are locked except a small one in the entrance. The kitchen is very tiny and is not suitable for cooking: walls and ceiling get covered by water. No basics to cook (no sugar, oil, pepper...).",NEGATIVE
"There was a big and weird white stain on the blanket and pillows also look a bit dirty. The place was same as the pictures and nice, but we couldn't think of sleeping on the bed after seeing them and ended up leaving the place at night. I respecfully described the bad experience to the host and asked him to care more about cleaning for next guests, but it was really disappointing that he just said there had been no other guest who complained about that before. But I was complaing about what actually happened, and I think the host should've been more responsible for a guest's bad experience because I didn't pay for the stay on a dirty bed that I can see someone's mark. Sorry for leaving a bad review, but this is my experience in this place.",NEGATIVE
"Be wary that the location is not where they say it is, if you arrive from the central station you have to take 2 buses and it takes almost 40 minutes to get to their property. The property itself was big and very clean, unfortunately it did not offer the privacy we had hoped for - the curtains were see through and did not cover the whole window nor was there a curtain for the window by the front door, this meant the host could see in to where the bed area was from outside.",NEGATIVE
"Great location, cafe is non functional and the host was slow to respond to Airbnb messages and never responded to WhatsApp messages to the number he provided.",NEGATIVE
The host did not provide check-in instructions and was completely unresponsive when I arrived. I waited 2 hours while contacting airbnb support only to have the booking cancelled and I was stranded looking for new accommodation.,NEGATIVE
"I stayed at the Eight room hotel on Södermalm, Stockholm for 2 months and wasn't very pleased! It was during the covid period so I got a great discount (about 65%) but still thought it was overpriced. In the comments/reviews from previous guests, everybody mentioned a nice breakfast that was included. But after I had stayed there for 2 days I wrote the owner and asked why the café wasn't open, so I could get my breakfast. He blamed Corona (even though both cafés and hotels all over Stockholm was open), and said that was why I got a discount (which hasn't been mentioned anywhere in the description of the hotel). After having stayed there for 16 days I had to contact the owner again to ask them to come and clean my room, change my towels and bed sheets... That shouldn't happen in a hotel, that should happen automatically once a week. After I wrote them, they started showing up more frequently but not consistently. Generally my room was very quiet except for when I flushed my toilet (I had a private bathroom, unlike some of the other rooms in the hotel), then it sounded like I had four neighbours, all drilling a hole in the wall at the same time (same thing goes for when I was showering). The other time when the room wasn't quiet was from precisely 23.53 (11.53 PM) until 5 - 7.00 AM in the morning. At 23.53 the ventilation system became super loud! However, it was a very efficient ventilation system, because even though I couldn't open the window in my room, it never really became smelly - so that was nice. Another good thing was that they put an electric fan into my room, and on my request they also put in a small table I could use during my stay. All in all, not a very pleasant stay - I'll stay somewhere else next time.",NEGATIVE
wouldn't do it again,NEGATIVE
Worst AirBNB stay I have ever had. Room was way hot to sleep. Also the place looked like It was middle of renovation.,NEGATIVE
"I was not happy with my stay and will not come again. Positive: 1. The beds are comfortable, this is really nice. I slept very well. 2. The location is very central, it is easy to get around. Negative: 1. At the check in, I was booked into the wrong room and needed to change the room later 2. The hotel looked a bit like it was under construction, there was some sort of white paper all across the floor. I assume this is usually put when craftsman walk around, to save the floor from damages. it looked not very good 3. There was a beeping device in the hotel lobby which I herd during night in my room. I had earplugs so it was not too bad and I could sleep well - but my sleep would have been affected negatively without my own earplugs 4. I was in room 4 with a daylight window - I didn´t see any way to close the blind. there is a blind installed, but I didn´t see a tool to close it. So at 7:30 am it was already very bright in the room, I had to use my sleeping mask.",NEGATIVE
"I was very disappointed in the outcome of this reservation. Dolores cancelled my reservation the day of, 2 hours before I was scheduled to meet her to check in. I didn’t have anywhere to stay and was then left on my own to find different accommodations, as she stopped responding to my messages.",NEGATIVE
"Gabriella's home is lovely and in a perfect location with grocery stores and restaurants close by, an amazing food/market hall just blocks away, lovely stores and easy access to other parts of town. However, we were disappointed by her lack of care for hosting. Several things made our experience unpleasant: - She didn't send us any check-in instructions, so when we arrived late at night we had no idea where the key was or which apartment was hers. We had to call her (thankfully she picked up). - She didn't send us any instructions for her home, such as how to control the heat, how work the television, how to work the induction stove, or where to put the garbage. As a result, we had to message her repeatedly with questions. - She left someone else's trash in the garbage bin when we arrived. Sadly, it felt like she was only hosting for the money and didn't care about our experience as guests. When staying in someone's home for close to a week and paying almost $1,000 we were hoping for more thoughtfulness and attention to detail.",NEGATIVE
"Building under construction and dusty with dark lobby. Apartment is not very clean; no place for shoes, coats, or suitcase. Dirty laundry basket full and no area in shower for toiletries. Also looked like used towels. Kitchen and coffee maker not cleaned. Uncomfortable couch. Bed is huge but hubby uses machine and no table to put it on. Bed takes up whole area (not a room but a wall dividing it from living room. We had to climb over each other to get out of bed. Wardrobe full. We have never stayed in an Airbnb that the owner actually lives in. Had I know in advance, I would have stayed elsewhere. Way over priced for what you get.",NEGATIVE
"Warning: I never met Philip, a friend of him was staying in the apartment and was the one handing over the keys. Everything went well until night two when this friend first woke me up by playing laud electric guitar around 01am at night. Same night this friend, around 60 year old man, entered my doorm where I was sleeping 4 in the night. I don't wanna think of what his intention was, he well knew I was there. Would not recommend anyone styaing there with this friend of Philip.",NEGATIVE
"Embla was very friendly and pleasant . We didn’t actually meet her during our stay , but check in and out was smooth. The apartment is very alternative , a lot of unusual and slightly strange images , photos and painting decorate the place . The whole apartment is very strong smelling of a kind of woody incense scent . I wouldn’t book this place again , the beds were not comfortable and there was a stain on the larger main bed. The second room with a single bed is not ideal either. The place is good value for money as it’s quite keep , so great if your on a budget .",NEGATIVE
"If you need a room, this is the place. No extra frills in terms of breakfast or other amenities. but that s not what I needed.",NEGATIVE
Awsome place!,NEGATIVE
"Tommy's place is in a great location and it is very nicely decorated and clean. We unfortunately had a stressful and hard time checking in because we arrived just after 9pm due to a cancelled train and Tommy was away and unable to open the gate to his building. As cancellations of flights and trains are on the rise, do be aware that you may not be able to get access to Tommy's apartment and you will not get refunded (Airbnb confirmed that they could not assist as this 9pm check-in cut off was stated on his listing). We were lucky and decided to loiter out the front of the building and someone let us in after 15minutes but that may not always happen!",NEGATIVE
Host is disrespectful,NEGATIVE
"Our host was extremely responsive and the home was clean with comfortable beds in a great location. I do not believe the noise description is accurate, and I hate to say anything negative, but I wish others would have provided more detailed information about the noise situation in their reviews. Based on what we read, it sounded like there was going to be a restaurant and you assume that’s going to be a dull roar and ending as they describe before 1 AM which would be tolerable. This is not the case. The place is located on a very busy street with loud abrupt noises happening throughout the night - and most every morning starting at about 4AM there is a ruckus with street cleaning, restaurant cleaning, bottles clanking and I’m not even sure what else was going on outside the windows. I use a Sleep Fan and unfortunately it was no match to what was happening outside of the king bedroom. I do feel the room with the two single beds was quieter. Everything else was wonderful!!!",NEGATIVE
"Heads up. This is a very loud location if you sleep in the front (street) bedroom. It wasn't even the restaurant noise that was the difficult part of our stay, it was the delivery trucks to said restaurant that would start their very loud deliveries as early as 4 AM. It was usually about 3 deliveries every morning (or maybe taking away garbage idk?) This continued all weekday mornings until about 9 or 10 when things opened. It was absolutely brutal. Ear plugs helped, but it was impossible to sleep through loud, what I can only guess was glass bottle deliveries, that sounded like they were actually breaking the bottles in order to deliver them. That said, the apartment is BEAUTIFUL. The space was well maintained and very clean. The location is absolutely SUPERB. The hosts were SUPER responsive.",NEGATIVE
"I lived Rovaniemi, and Oslo apartment these days, they are cheaper and cleaner. This apartment is not clean, the oven inside is very dirty, no one clean it. The table is unstable, when we sit and use the table to have our breakfast, the table will shake. One light is broken, no one fix it.The commode is dirty. Compare with other apartment, it doesn't worthy",NEGATIVE
"The location of the flat is great, as it is close to a subway station. The city is easily accessible on foot or by electric scooter. However it seems that the flat has not been cleaned. The floor was sticky, there was dust on the chandeliers and on the tables and there was hair stuck to the sink. We were quite disappointed, as the flat looked very clean in the photos. In addition, the sofa bed is very uncomfortable. It sags and is unstable. Even though we are only 25 years old, our backs were very sore.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment needs serious attention. The living room pendant light has only one working bulb, making it dim. The microwave handle is missing a bottom screw. An exposed outlet gave me a shock, posing a severe safety hazard. I reported this to Hedvig, but she couldn’t find a repairman to fix it. The bedroom lamps are unsteady and need tightening. The TV didn’t work; either the remotes need batteries or the TV itself needs repair. In the bathroom, the particle board cabinet door where the washer is located is falling apart and growing black mold, creating a serious health risk. Overall, I was extremely disappointed. Hedvig’s inability to find anyone to address the hazardous electrical problem was frustrating. The lack of responsiveness to these safety and maintenance issues made my stay uncomfortable and stressful. It’s unacceptable to leave guests in such a hazardous environment without taking immediate action. I expected a much higher standard of care and concern for guest safety.",NEGATIVE
"Apartment was in a great location, but the space was very small. Very little counterspace and hard to use any of the appliances as both the coffee, pot and kettle stored on top of the microwave. The sofa bed was also very small and not very comfortable. I would suggest this would be a better space for a couple..",NEGATIVE
"Robin went out of her way the first night we were in Sweden, we realized we had no converters and no way to charge our phones….. She made a personal call to a friend who came to our rescue. My only complaint is that when I wanted to extend my stay one additional night and found that the room was not yet booked, she sent me a booking request that was twice the price that I was paying for one night. When I pointed it out she said weekends cost more and that she would alter it and then sent me a price even higher. After I complained, She explained that she can’t change things on the app easily and that she would adjust it. She eventually fixed it, and offered a great rate but by that time I already felt like changing plans. Once you have the feeling of someone trying to take advantage of a situation (regardless if it was by accident) it makes you weary. Room was very clean and has everything we needed. Nice stay",NEGATIVE
"Nice apartment , centralized. Just one thing I was not like, the room No2 is just faced with entrance , with 2 camera on both side, which let me feel uncomfortable",NEGATIVE
"The apartment was nice and clean, and it was easy to travel to the city centre by subway. The only problem we had was that we had 3 people staying at the apartment, but the host did not provide bedding for the sofa bed, and he never replied to my message asking for the bedding.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment was clean, but a bad smell was coming out from the bathroom.",NEGATIVE
Seemed like an okay place. The bathroom wasn't very clean and it really isn't a shower in my opinion. Not many towels as well.,NEGATIVE
Overall good place but the carpet had a lot of stains and it would be better if they used something else to clean it other than regural vaccums.,NEGATIVE
There was pee on the toilet seat and hair in the shower. The carpet is also really dirty. The refrigerator was not on and it was really wet inside. Otherwise the place is nicely planned. Casting to the TV was nice. Clean towels and bed.,NEGATIVE
"This posting does say without windows, but we found it a bit more disorienting than we thought. The aircon is controlled by the building and cannot be adjusted in the room, which left the room warm and without a window to have a breeze it was stuffy. But my biggest issue was the noise. There was this crazy noise that after three nights I still wasn’t sure where it was coming from, but it was like a creek/croaking that happen sporadically throughout the day and through the night, which was very disruptive to sleeping. We were there with our toddler and even had a sound machine on and it woke us all often. The room was described correctly and was very clean. The location is a bit more residential than would have preferred, but went with it as we booked a week before.",NEGATIVE
"We stayed in flat 19 which is in the Niro hotel/apartment complex. It was well located, comfortable and well equipped. However we may have completely missed the fact when we booked that the flat/room is in the basement with no window or natural light and centralised air conditioning over which we had no control. This was a disappointment as we like fresh air and it was mid summer in Stockholm!",NEGATIVE
"The room was undergound and with no window, which I hate. Eitherwise it was good and with good facilities and the people there were really kind",NEGATIVE
"the room was OK, nothing personal. the bad thing I found out was a lot of hair in the shower, this was disgusting and looked like nobody had cleaned. also some strange rules about garbage? just didn't understand. was I expected to clean myself, this is why I pay a cleaning fee in Airbnb payment! also microwave was very awkward and difficult to use. not enough soaps to have a proper shower.",NEGATIVE
No windows. That was very disappointing.,NEGATIVE
This was the worst Airbnb experience i have ever had . Robin The host was very very rude and accused me of doing something i didnt do . He started yelling and shouting at me because i wouldnt take bullshit from him. And telling me because his a host he could do whatever he wanted . This whole experience give me the worst anxiety attack i have had . I had to check out 3 days before my initial check out day because i didnt feel safe or comfortable being there . The worst part is i know i didnt do what he said i did because there are cameras in the building and told him to check it . Which he did . I never got an apology Robins Behavior towards me . Since he owns the place he feels like he has the right to talk to a paying customer that way . His an asshole !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,NEGATIVE
"Stylish place, great value for money in a well-located neighborhood. My only complaint is that the room shared a wall with student housing next door. As students do, they stayed up late talking and playing music loudly, which made it hard to sleep. Robin & Niclas were very responsive to the noise complaints and intervened with the manager of the student housing, unfortunately to no avail, as the late-night noise persisted for several nights in a row. Just keep this in mind or request a room that doesn't abut the student living quarters.",NEGATIVE
"Nice place to stay for a few days. Location is very close to metro so found it very easy to get everywhere. Easy check in and in a nice quiet neighbourhood. We knew when booking no windows but unsure we would do it again, waking up in completely darkness is very weird and makes it a lot harder to get out of bed! And makes you confused about the time so do think about that before booking! Heating didn’t seem to come on yet no windows meant it wasn’t that cold. But pipes making noises all night was a bit annoying but overall good experience.",NEGATIVE
We didn’t enjoy our stay here ended up leaving a day early after only one night we thought that with no windows there would be some sort of air conditioning or ventilation but it was hot and stuffy. There were red stains on the carpet next to the table.,NEGATIVE
"The space was good, however it was not possible to open the window and there was a smoke detection system in the apartment with a $2,000 fine if triggered. How am I going to make meat with that risk? The extractor hood installed was very weak and I didn't want to take that risk, so I couldn't use the kitchen as I had imagined. Another point is that basic things that are available in virtually every Airbnb I stayed in did not exist, such as olive oil, coffee, tea and dish towels.",NEGATIVE
Very dusty environment. No cleaning included even if you're staying multiple months. Check-in shared with the actual hotel and is not focused on Longstay.,NEGATIVE
A staff member let himself into my room at 9am when checkout isn’t until 11! No reason given He didn’t knock first I wasn’t dressed and he was stood peeping into my room! It’s a shame this happened as apartment is in a perfect location comfortable beds,NEGATIVE
Wasn’t as clean as passed reviews lead me to believe and not actually in “Södermalm”,NEGATIVE
"I responded on a text that the host sent on the second day of our stay and they never came back with an answer on my complaints/comments. The elevator and the common areas were not clean, on the hallway and the room there was a distinct smell from spicy food and the bathroom shower gel dispenser didn’t work.",NEGATIVE
"Clean, tidy, corresponds to pics and description. Non-charming prohibition signs on walls in the apartment makes you feel not at home. No check-in instructions on email as promised and no answer on messages, had to call to get it.",NEGATIVE
Great check in experience . But didn’t get a good response and they were not empathizing with the fact we need to leave early despite much advance notice due to covid and family emergency. Room cleaning was ok but not 100% great,NEGATIVE
"Unfortunately this place is not safe, while Covid is on. I have got Covid symptoms and confirmed test during the stay in the ApartDirect. When I reported it to the hotel stuff they didn't offer any help, trash should have been taken out by me outside the building, which would have put other guests in danger of getting covid, so I had to keep it inside till the end of my stay. Luckily I don't feel any smells) The hotel has a central air system (not sure if that was safe for other guests), and dishes are washed by previous guests. (I washed mine, how long is the virus staying on plates?) The hotel had some issues with extending my stay, which resulted cleaning staff knocking on the door not wearing masks, so totally unprepared for cleaning a room of a sick person. Location and room is very nice and as in the photos, but really not suitable for 2021 and ongoing pandemic.",NEGATIVE
"The ventilation system was incredibly noisy, I had to buy some earplugs. Moreover, several objects were missing. There was no sponge to clean the dishes, the shampoo was already run out and there wasn't the laundry detergent.",NEGATIVE
"Not terrible, but I do not recommend. The room was clean except the filter above the stove. It was extremely nasty and looked like it hadn't been cleaned for months. Indoor climate was unpleasant. Found silver fish bugs, but they're pretty harmless and common in Sweden. They've also blocked Sweden's biggest online forum from their WiFi.",NEGATIVE
"Location and check-in were good. Unfortunately there was no temperature control that was accessible to us. We had to keep the shades drawn in order for the apartment not to feel like a sauna. The windows were bolted shut so you can't open the windows. I also asked for a fan, but they were not able to provide one. Unfortunately, this made the apartment unlivable. But if they fixed this issue, it could be a good place.",NEGATIVE
"Good location, comfortable bed, and spacious room, but I felt overpriced. Kitchen stuff and dishes etc. were not clean so I had to wash them when I arrived.",NEGATIVE
Nice stay but bathroom wasn't clean.,NEGATIVE
"Apartment was clean and spacious. Close to at least two grocery stores and to public transport. We could not figure out why the dryer did not work, but might be a mistake on our part.",NEGATIVE
"VERY BAD ATENTION. At the begining we were very confortable at the room, but the last night a ventilator started to run in the room producing noise and cold air. We called the emergency number, but the person that answer it told us that he wasnt able to solve the problem, because the temperature of the room was out of his control. We asked then for changing the room because it was imposible to sleep with that noise and that cold, but he told us he wasn't able to help us with that neither, and he actually didn't know if the hotel was or not complete. He said that he could only help if we would had lost the room code, anything else. Right now I dont have any answer from the appartment after I report the incident. So the place is not bad, but you dont have any support if you have any problem, so I wouldn't recomend it.",NEGATIVE
"Overall the space is nice. You have all the utilities you’ll need. My main problem that I encountered was a broken washing machine that never got fixed and the host took my clothes to wash, which I would assume dried too. However, I came back to my clothes just thrown into a bag still wet. I had some pretty nice clothes sat in a broken washer 2.5 days smelling very bad into being washed and thrown into a bag and it ruined them. It did not feel like they cared very much for the inconvenience that the broken washing machine caused.",NEGATIVE
"Very cold experience, it's like being in a hotel without reception so you cannot even ask for clean towels/sheet, they give you lots of rules but you cannot open windows to change air nor you can control the heating. If 1 or more guests stay for more than... say 3 days... I WOULD ASSUME you would allow them to receive clean towels/sheets, I stayed a week using the same towels, not the best experience. Especially in these time of pandemic, being able to open the windows sometimes to change air inside the room would be amazing. Heating control was not even working nor explained. The pictures provided are just from a random flat, since you got 100s of those flats which is misleading when choosing. In my opinion not worth the money",NEGATIVE
Only thing I missed was a sponge,NEGATIVE
"Good location, close to the tram. Apartment kitchen was really dirty. No communication when queried on the app.",NEGATIVE
The place was not clean enough; I was expecting more for the price we paid.,NEGATIVE
"This Airbnb is in a perfect location with stores and the bus stop a quick 3 minute walk. One thing to note is that the blinds on the building would automatically close when the sun was hitting, and the room temperature was too warm for our taste and we had no control over changing that. The communication was also the worst communication I’ve ever had with an Airbnb. I was confused about the check in process days before check in, and the person in charge would not respond to my messages to clear up my confusion.",NEGATIVE
"On the positive side, our room was rather spacious, this hotel is cheap and not that far from the city center. However, we were quite disappointed with this hotel. You cannot open windows (in most rooms of the hotel), you cannot choose how much air conditioning goes into the room so the air is very dry and smells musty. We even had to change our room at the beginning as the smell was terrible. You cannot control shutters so at some point during the morning the room was dark and we couldn’t do anything about that. Lastly, our room was very dirty, notably the floor under the bed and in the bathroom which were covered by hair and big chunks of dust. Overall, we didn’t have a good experience there and we won’t come back for sure.",NEGATIVE
Very disappointed! I booked the apartment a month before my trip and a few days after my mom got terribly sick and I had to cancel my trip to Stockholm as I need to help take care of her. I messaged ApartDirect asking if they could make an exception with their no cancellation policy and they said no. This was more than 3 weeks notice before my check in date so they would have well enough time to find another guest. I didnt end up going so they rather have the apartment stay empty than find someone that would actually enjoy their stay. Money hungry!,NEGATIVE
"the communication with the company was very bad, mails are not read or answered and after working hours, the phone is not answered. The air intake above the kitchen unit makes a hell of a noise... like a fax device that is calling... you have no control in the room regarding heat or cold, nor the curtains outside... all is automatic according to their rules... Took us two days to get a solution.",NEGATIVE
Okay place to crash,NEGATIVE
"The apartment was nice and clean and had everything you need, and check-in as well as check-out was easy. So far so good. However: The location is far off from how it's marketed. We were led to believe it was in Södermalm, but it was very far off. It changed our whole holiday and made it a lot harder. Another big downside with the apartment was that it was simply too cold, and due to a centralised air conditioning system the temperature cannot be adjusted. It affected our stay negatively, unfortunately.",NEGATIVE
"We were disappointed with our stay in this apartment. Our biggest problem was that central AC couldn’t be turned off or regulated in any way - and it blew crazy strong whole day and night earning us a soar throat and runny nose - all while the outside temperature was pleasant 15-20 C. Unfortunately windows could also not be open, so instead of enjoying fresh and cool outside air you are stuck with automatic AC. Shades are also automatically controlled and are brought down covering whole windows completely quite early in the morning, around 8 AM - making us feel like we are in a box. Communication with host was not up to the standards - they provided wrong entry code, responded with significant delays and didn’t offer any solution or alternatives for the problems with AC. There was a sign in the kitchenette that leaving dirty dishes will result in additional charges to the credit card - however we found dirty dishes in the cupboard and drawers and did not appreciate these double standards and shifting of the responsibility for the hygiene to the guests in such a way. Additionally the apartment is not a walking distance away from the city center, unfortunately the key tram line was under constructions so we had quite limited options with only one bus that was not operating very frequently, so it took much more time to reach any desired destination. this however is out of the host’s hands and temporary, I’m sure will change once the works are over, but other issues we’ve described in our opinion are a matter of the approach and professional standards of the host.",NEGATIVE
"All good (overall speaking), but two things: - The kitchen air extractor was dirty and kinda gross, like with oil and food particles stuck on it from previous usage. - The washing machine dryer was simply not working at all. We contacted ApartDirect service for it and a technician came by like 6 days after our requirement. The problem itself wasn't solved, and he even acknowledged that the machine was not drying quite good recently. So it was kinda like ""it's what it is"" situation. :) Besides that, our stay and commodities were good and the zone is pretty chill and beautiful!",NEGATIVE
"Building’s blinds are centrally steered. On the week from the 08th to the 14th of august something with the central steering system was broken so that all apartments on the motorway side of the building had their blind shut down all day long, alle week long.",NEGATIVE
"Turn key hotel pretending to provide a typical Airbnb cozy experience. I reported my stove fan was non-functional on the first day and I didn’t even get the courtesy of a response let alone someone actually coming to fix it although I was staying there for 6 days. Not a lot of supplies provided at all literally only salt. When I was ready to do my laundry on the last day no detergent provided either. I guess technically these amenities are not included but come on, detergent is cheap and somewhat expected given I’ve never had a similar experience at another Airbnb. Might as well just stay at a hotel then but at least they provide concierge there is nothing of the kind here. I would not stay again",NEGATIVE
"very poor communication with the client, no flexibility concerning departure days, and 500 euros wasted for a sub par living space in which you can't open windows. The corridor smelled like a bad cafeteria, no fresh air because the whole building run on air conditioning. Also the building is facing a freeway so not the best view in town.",NEGATIVE
"The room was okay but it smelled funny and the bathroom floor was dirty. Very expensive for what it is. Location isn't the greatest. There was always a weird and scary music in the background. Also, the maintenance guy knocked and walked in immediately without waiting for a response.",NEGATIVE
"Absolutely no communication from the hosts of this apartment. I texted the number multiple times and had no response. We thought we forgot a small piece of jewellery in the apartment when we checked out, and I texted the owners to see if they could check if we had left it there. 4 days later and still no response. The cooker is way too small, the cooking utensils are not great, the frying pan is too small. No basic items available - cooking oil, salt, hairdryer, washing cloths. No dish washer. Some of the plates, cutlery were dirty, clearly the apartment was not cleaned well. For the money spent, not worth it. Get a hotel in the city centre, you'll save money on transport and actually have some customer service.",NEGATIVE
"Good overall, but the room was pretty cold, weird constant noise and it didn’t smell very good.",NEGATIVE
"Door code was not working, needed to call customer service. Room was in generally nice and how described. In the evening there was some sound that we couldn’t understand where and why it was coming, probably from bathroom. Bathroom looked a bit older and we has some problems with water going down after shower. Kitchen was equipped well, but fyi coffee needed to by yourself and the fridge had a bit bad smell. Otherwise would recommend, was close to local transportation and city centre.",NEGATIVE
On the whole the stay was excellent. Just a couple of negative points. The apartment was not very warm however we were offered a fan heater. The internet speed was not great especially in the evenings it was so slow I could not work. The bathroom floor was not quite correct as when having a shower almost the whole bathroom was covered with water.,NEGATIVE
"Pretty cold inside, although there was a heating unit, it did not help much as there was an air vent blowing cold air and disturbing noises towards the bed (apparently this cannot be fixed). Host came into the house without notifiying me beforehand and they informed me only afterwards. That is not cool.",NEGATIVE
All perfect but the kitchen didn’t work very well,NEGATIVE
"Descripción said it was possible to leave luggage in a locker before the check in time but when I arrived there was only one locker available and it was broken so I had to wait 3 hours there till check in time. Bathroom was not clean , I found blood stains on the tiles next to the wc, I sent 2 emails with pictures and it took 22 hours before somebody came to clean it. Hairs on the bed board. Kitchen supplies, ,pans ,dishes ,cups and glasses were very dirty. Very slow communication. Too bad because the studio is overall nice and comfortable.",NEGATIVE
"Nice clean apartment with good basic kitchen amenities, and good access to public transport. The main problem for us was no ability to control the heating, we found it extremely hot and difficult to sleep",NEGATIVE
"The location is close to public transport, so it's easy to get anywhere. Main problem was that the place was not really clean and also the rooms were really cold and we could not set temperature inside the room. Blankets were also really thin, so during the night the place was pretty bad.",NEGATIVE
"Very spacious, clean and tidy studio. Linen was fresh and had spares in the cupboard. Beautiful decor and ambiance in the lobby. However there was a constant noise in the room and when reported through the chat, i did not get a response and it did make it harder to rest.",NEGATIVE
"It’s a budget apartment so need to keep that in mind. Has the feel of a hostel more than anything. A couple of issues but nothing major looking at the reviews again now they seem in line with all the others. Apartment cold and unable to change temperature as set for entire building. Have empty drinks bottles and food left in fridge. You will notice the smell of bleach throughout. Location was ok, close to tram line and buses. For a budget stay it is what it is.",NEGATIVE
Fit for purpose and good location. Not good if claustrophobic as windows do not open and felt very stuffy. Also far too hot and no response when asked if turning the heating down was an option.,NEGATIVE
"Room stank of cigarettes, for 2 days nobody responded via email or airbnb. Windows don’t open so we couldn’t even ventilate it. It was so bad that we just booked another place for the last night, and will be formally complaining to airbnb about the apartment.",NEGATIVE
"Unfortunately our room was changed a minute before check-in and the other room wasn‘t cleaned, yet. They did clean it almost immediately after we complained, but it still took them an hour, which was terrible after a 12 hrs ride. It took them a week to get this issue discussed and fixed. The apartment itself was as expected. Big enough, tidy (after cleaning) and close to public transportation. Only the part of town is another one than stated. It‘s NOT Södermalm, it‘s Hammarby. Which is a huge difference. Also there were some explosions in a nearby construction side. It would‘ve been great to be informed about that before our trip. We went to bed early after the long car ride and were standing in bed wide awake, when the first explosion came! The price is quite alright for an apartment like that. Small kitchen with everything you need, supermarkets very close and 3 minutes walk to public transportation. If you‘re looking for an okay-priced apartment that‘s a go-to.",NEGATIVE
"I recently stayed at a Stockholm apartment that had some positives but was ultimately disappointing due to several negative issues. The bed was comfortable, and the location was decent, situated in a quiet neighborhood with good coffee shops and supermarkets nearby. However, the host failed to disclose that they were overbooked, resulting in the unavailability of the original apartment. Their dismissive response forced me to leave after just one night. The internet connection was slow, adding to the dissatisfaction. There was significant noise from the ventilation system, making it difficult to sleep, and a strong smell from neighboring kitchens. These issues, combined with the host's lack of transparency, led to an overall unsatisfactory experience. I would not recommend this accommodation to other travelers.",NEGATIVE
"Checking in was a bit of a headache, I had to wait over an hour and lots of other people were having this problem, I had to call customer service at least 5 times, everything else was good",NEGATIVE
It was a great location though a bit of travel to get to the city Great you can catch the ferry The only complaint I had was it was freezing cold even though it was summer the air-con could not be adjusted. I had to put the heater on and no one could fix till the next day and it was still cold Seemed wrong to have the heater on,NEGATIVE
"We had problem for check in, I was waiting the email for confirm my id that supposed to arrive days earlier. After I called they said that they already send it, never arrived, they said that they will send another one, never arrived, had to call Air Bnb support to get the information I need, that they provide via What's app.",NEGATIVE
"Just OK. With years of travelling experience, this was our first time staying at apartment with no fresh air from window as the windows cannot be opened with empty hand. I am not sure if that meets safety standard.",NEGATIVE
"When we arrived the room was not cleaned and things of the people before us were still there. The person in charge did organise cleaning within a few hours, however we needed to stay close. Although we were refunded the first night: this sucked majorly. Then when we came to the apartment again we could see that it was cleaned in a rush, the floors were not completely clean, bed made but looking a bit chaotic, the washing machine stank of mould, tv not working. In the kitchen there was still food by the people before and all dishes we half-clean and we had to rewash before use. (This place needs a dishwasher!) The person in charge came in again and cleaned the washing machine, however, it definitely still smells like mould, which cannot be just wiped off, which was a big deal for us. The tv was replaced the same evening and chromecast fixed within the course of the next day. We also found out that some things that are in the listing are not available: e.g. oil salt pepper chopsticks. Also the help desk is not available due to covid which is also not stated in the listing! We also realised that the ventilation is quite loud which was not a big problem but a little annoying while sleeping. In total I would say that it does offer a solid apartment, however, after reading the listing I would have expected it to be a lot cleaner. I really disliked things mentioned in the listing missing. After all that happened to us, there is not a chance I would come back. Also I think for the location the price is a bit high. A plus was definitely the person in charge who did really want to fix our problems - thanks again!",NEGATIVE
Very disappointed with the service,NEGATIVE
"I wouldn't go back after our experience. The studio is like the pictures except for the tidyness. The bed and sofa had stains and a lot of hair from previous guests. The bathroom was also poorly cleaned. Another thing we noticed is that the shower doesnt close propperly so when you take a shower the bathroomfloor gets wet. Next morning when we made breakfast we found out that cuttlery, pans and pots werent cleaned asswell. Another point of improvement is the time needed to receive a reaction. After booking the cofirmation took about 7 hours, after that we had some questions about checking in but due to poor service it took a long time to get in contact and resolve the matter.",NEGATIVE
The apartment is as it looks in the advertisement. It is very clean and the neighbour its fine but it is not very good comunicated with the center. The check in and check out is very confortable,NEGATIVE
"Apartment was spacious but smelled a bit (esp. the fridge) and the toilet had not been cleaned. A few lightbulbs didn't work either. Could not be bothered reaching out to the host to get this fixed as we only stayed for two nights. OK experience, but will probably not book again.",NEGATIVE
"The room was not ready at the provided check-in time. When I asked the staff member who was cleaning the room when it would be ready, she looked confused and said no one had booked the room. She showed me the room schedule on her phone and my reservation was not there, which was not comforting. When I showed her my reservation, she said the room would be ready in a few minutes. After checking in, another staff member came by and asked if the room was ok. When I tried to ask her about the check-in situation, she said that was not what she had asked and did not address anything I said, which was pretty rude and inconsiderate.",NEGATIVE
"The appartment was really nice, but we had some problems with getting in. The host was not responding to our messages. Also, the appartment was not sufficiently equipped. Despite, the appartment was clean and well located.",NEGATIVE
Sofa for sleeping was not so confortable.,NEGATIVE
"Good for the money, good location. Communication not so great. Strict rules, the late offered check out did not work out.",NEGATIVE
Everything as described. Unfortunately wifi is slow and unstable. It might not be suitable for work.,NEGATIVE
"Ok, but not great Lots of “rules” under the threat of being charged extra after, for example for leaving dirty dishes(i know and i agree that is common sense to wash them, but still you don t have to threaten the guests for it). Also, if you pretend to have evertyhing washed, at least have a place to deposit the dishes after doing so. The place was clean. Thin walls.",NEGATIVE
Grossery store is far away . Not good for long stay.,NEGATIVE
"My worst AirBnB experience so far. The room was extremly cold. I have been told the heater was broken but nobody has ever come to fix it. Also, the temperature can not be controlled by guests within the room, only by the property owner so I am not even sure whether it was really broken or they just do not turn it on. We ended up wearing thermal clothes and hats inside the room, really ridiculous. Thanks to AirBnB support we got our booking cancelled, fully refunded and could move to much better place. Apart of that, the room is inside an aparthotel with nobody at reception desk, really noisy as the walls are thin and you can hear all sounds from the hallway. Wifi works ok. The place is only good for on buget short stays in summer.",NEGATIVE
they will not honor a mistake and will keep your money when there is more than sufficient evidence to prove the mistake.,NEGATIVE
"Good value and nice modern apartment. However, there are a few caveats that you should be aware of: - There’s no room temperature control so your stay may become a bit uncomfortable (too hot or too cold) - There’s no train station nearby so getting to the city centre takes a bus + train. - Check-in requires identity verification - uploading your selfie and ID. I don’t think this is a standard requirement. - The host response outside of working hours seems to be limited. I reported a Cast to TV function not working. While the issue was acknowledged, nothing was done about it. On the upside: - Clean and modern apartment. - Shops and a few nice cafes nearby - Quiet area",NEGATIVE
"Good apartment, not a very good communication with the host to improve the clean and the communication",NEGATIVE
"Garbage from other customers was left in the apartment, the dishes were not properly washed. There is also no salt, sugar, coffee or tea in the apartments. The apartment is located next to the shopping center COOP. There are also cafes, a public transport stop, and convenient transportation nearby.",NEGATIVE
"The couch was really dirty, we found tissues when we opened it. Moreover the bedsheets were wet. The cleanliness was really disappointing.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is very close to the ferry pier to the center. The view of the apartment on the highway is not very nice. Unfortunately, you could only dim the flat on one side, which was a bit difficult with toddlers. The bathroom should be cleaned better, the tiles and joints are moldy. I think price-performance is not completely consistent.",NEGATIVE
"Nice location with an easy check-in, Unfortunately there is some fan on the roof just above the apartment making terrible noises, weren’t able to sleep at all during the stay due to this. Contacted the owner about this but there was nothing to be done. I wouldn’t rent this place again due to the sound otherwise all good.",NEGATIVE
"Cleanliness was below standard. Floors were dusty and not mopped. The apartment has bad smell everywhere, from kitchen, fridge and bathrooms. The sink in the upper bathroom was clogged and the stopper full of hair and dirts. I asked to replace my apartment or cancel my reservation but response was delayed and negative, so I had to stay. Location was ok but far away from centre if you would use public transportation.",NEGATIVE
"When I met her, she seemed as a lovely person. But, then she told me that she won't be staying at her house and instead her friend with a dog and a child will. This she could have notified me in advance before arrived, but she didn't. Then she told me about her life and that she has many male friends who were in prison for rape, who she bilieves were innocent because they were drunk at the time. And, then I met her friend who was staying in the house.. a male friend... Ofc, I was afraid my safety, even if that her friend did nothing. So, I found a new place and left.",NEGATIVE
A high-quality AirBnB. Very sad that Edeysi is moving out and won't be offering stays in the future.,NEGATIVE
"Good location, good Interiur. Cleanlines is problematic, Bicycles could not be used.",NEGATIVE
Water damage stains on wall,NEGATIVE
"unfortunately upon my arrival in the apartment there were dirty dishes, used pots and rubbish from previous guests. the apartment had not been cleaned.",NEGATIVE
"Small but practical, clean and comfy. Good location, very close to train station with easy links to the city. Our issue was that one of the bed legs wasn’t fastened to the bed properly so it kept collapsing during the night. The thermostat didn’t seem to work and the temperature knob on the shower was missing as well.",NEGATIVE
horrible my friends went to visit me and the next day they took me out of the place because you can't receive a horrible visit,NEGATIVE
"Normal place for their price, not very clean, but again, for this price I think it is hard to find better.",NEGATIVE
"Not bad for price, location is fine. But our room was dusty, especially sofa was very dirty, impossible to sit.",NEGATIVE
Elevator did not work 3 days trip went on foot 14th floor. Apartments do not match the photo. In the apartment there was no washing machine. Long host answers (more than 24 hours). Forced to wait 5 hours before handing over the apartments.,NEGATIVE
If u really need its okey but would not choose it,NEGATIVE
"The real situation is much different from the picture, the room looks very clean just in the picture. I slept here all night with allergies, got a lot of pimples, and felt itchy all over my body. And only tableware is provided here, no detergent, no basic seasoning and oil, it is very inconvenient to cook. Only eat quick meals that can be heated in the microwave. So we moved somewhere else after only two days and I will never come here again. Ans even though I don't recommend this company.",NEGATIVE
"Don’t stay here. It has by far been our worst experience via airbnb yet. First of all they advertise with airconditioning, there is no airconditioning and our room wouldn’t get below 25 degrees celcius. The apartment itself hasn’t been maintained well. Beds are just wiggly and deel like they will fall apart every second. Faucets are not even screwed to the sink. Also it seems like they have never vacuumed under the beds. One night the lamp fell of in the middle of the night and another night the fire alarm started to beep at 2 am. They say that they will pick up your garbage once a day, this hasn’t been done even once during our 6 day stay. Also they won’t give you more than 1 towel per person during your stay. I contacted them with my concerns, but the only thing they could do is offer a discount for our next stay, which we of course will never book.",NEGATIVE
"I must complain, that dispite the fact shown in the listings regarding check out time it was not reflexted correctly! The door codes did not work, we could not use it at 11:25!!!! I think this is a problem, because it was difficult to get in the building and we need to ask help from the cleaning staff to get in our room as well…. I think it was not correct!",NEGATIVE
"3 minute walk to the train station that brings you directly into the city center. providing shower gel and shampoo means the cheapest hand soap. kitchen basics like salt, pepper, oil etc are NOT provided. the bed is super soft, so not really comfortable. the apartment could have definitely been cleaner but was overall ok. what was really annoying was the CONSTANT noise of the ventilation system, that you have in every room. also the fridge is very loud. due to the noises i would NOT recommend the apartment!",NEGATIVE
"The location is perfect right next to the train station. Check-in is easy and the room itself was ok. Communication with the host was poor to say the least (they didn't even reply to messages from airbnb itself). The morning after checking in we noticed a broken chair (was only noticeable when sitting on the chair) and immediately send them a message about it. Still haven't heard back. Also the streaming to the television didn't work. Also messaged the host, no reply. The room is advertised as having a double bed, but turned out to be two singles shoved together (on a slippery floor), so not a double at all. We ended up tying the bedposts together to avoid slipping inbetween them. All in all an ok stay, just not too much of a supportive host.",NEGATIVE
"A stones throw away from the Älvsjö train station, and even closer to a convenient bus stop. There's even a grocery store right around the corner, the apartment has everything you need to cook a full meal - which if you're planning to do... what's wrong with you? Anyway, after giving your ID and a selfie to apartmentdirect via an email - you get the code to get in. Which was slightly confusing at first, and may be worrysome to those who are afraid of data breaches. The beforementioned confusion had me type a message to the host on the app, which they never answered to. So if you want a completely stress-free booking, maybe not the place for you. The apartment was super clean, had big windows with thick curtains and clear instructions on the basic stuff you should know. There was no AC, and the switch on the wall - where you 'supposedly' could turn the heat up or down seemingly did nothing. However, for the price it was satisfying.",NEGATIVE
"there was a kettle and coffe machine, but there are no tea bags or coffee to brew. mattress is uncomfortably soft. thin walls, noizy fridge",NEGATIVE
"The accommodation in itself is great, very close and convenient to the city centre, nice clean and comfy apartment, easy access to the place and close to the station, nothing bad to say about the place itself. On the other hand, there was an absurdly loud party in the apartment above ours 2 nights in a row (at least, we left after the second time). I usually don’t mind it so much, people can party, but the amount of noise and the jumping on the floor made our nights a nightmare, despite parties being supposedly prohibited by their rules.. I tried to call their contact during the night (at 12, 2, and 3am both nights as it wouldn’t stop) and while they answered, they sometimes said they had nobody on site to do anything, or that they would send somebody to stop it but nothing ever happened, 2 absolutely awful nights… Again, we might have been unlucky with our neighbouring that time, the apartment and location is nice, but their customer service not so much this time…",NEGATIVE
"They need to improve their responce time.. One evening room was very hot, we requested for help.. next day message comes, we don't respond after 5 PM. what will happen if there is an emergency. contact no should shared and visible in the room",NEGATIVE
"kitchen is very inconvenient, no coffee or tea bag. no paper towels, no salt, no cooking oil. do not recommend.",NEGATIVE
"Toilet and the building as a whole doesn't smell good. Make sure there are coffee filter, toilet paper, pans and sponges in the kitchen. Great location, good heating in the apartment.",NEGATIVE
"A bit of false advertising. Completly different Apartment to the one we booked. At least what we thought we’d booked. First 20 out of the 22 pictures were of a totally different apartment. So we were a bit disappointed. The smell is really bad, tried spraying perfume around, making coffee, even tried not opening the windows when we cooked to make the smell go away. It is very distinct and not very pleasant. Other than that, the apartment was clean. We tried communicating for earlier check in and they replied to contact them on the day of arrival. We did but never received a reply back.",NEGATIVE
"SCAM: 19 of 22 photos are not of this place! Only the last three are. Neither the host nor Airbnb did a thing about it when we complained. It was also very noisy (bar floor below), not clean (food leftovers in the oven), and generally run down (oven fan, TV and toaster not working). Don’t stay here - or anywhere with ApartDirect!",NEGATIVE
"It’s not 2 beds. It’s 1 bed and a sofa. Everything inside the apartment is old and about to break. Response time is long. They don’t respond on the weekend. Was given a wrong code to enter the apartment, had to use international calling to reach the host. Location is great though.",NEGATIVE
"This is a great place to stay while in Gamla Stan, you’re right in the midst of the old town. The lack of a sofa that one can sit on was disappointing, we tried, but as others have mentioned, it’s bad.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is in a good ovation but it does not match the listing. It is tire, the furniture has been swapped put from the pictured. The couch is a love seat and no comfortable chair(s) to sit in. The floors are rough and there are not rugs. The bathroom is large but tile is dirty and fixings are cheap. Also parking is very expensive. The recommended parking requires an app and is well over $65 a day. This should have been addressed so that other arrangements could be made. There is no welcome package, maps or suggested places to see or dine. Plus, the unit is over a pub. The noise level is very high until 1 to 2 pm. The windows are single paned. I know the building is old, but there has been little investment made. It is not worth the price. made",NEGATIVE
"I had to wait 2 hours in front of the building, in the cold, as they forgot to provide me the code of the door",NEGATIVE
Oven is dirty. No bowls provided. Washing dishes is compulsory for the guests but no scouring pad provided. Wifi is now working in the kitchen and bathroom. The drying machine is not really working and our clothes are not dried completely. The environment is quite noisy.,NEGATIVE
"pros: great location, cute neighborhood, big apartment, clean and cute. cons: company not welcoming, door did not open 2 minutes before check in, no condiments, no coffee, no laundry soap, bare cupboards, no welcome kit water note etc, lots of signs around threatening to fine you for violations of the rules. this company doesn't understand hospitality. wont be renting from apartdirect in future.",NEGATIVE
"Great location in the heart of Old Town, which we highly appreciated and recommend for anyone. There was a laundry dryer BUT it took a whole 24 hours and more to get it work- it was not working so we reached out to the host, who asked us take a pictures of the laundry machine and asked us to send the model number … etc, etc, while they were not very quick to respond. We needed to wait for the next day for their responses. This part was frustrating because it felt as if we came to Stockholm to fix the laundry machine, while we’re on vacation (and we needed to do laundry badly). To be fair, the dryer worked on our last day. Other parts, such as hot water and street noise issues, were as described and as others say (so we were prepared and able to manage).",NEGATIVE
More of a hotel than an apartment. It’s fine but there’s no where you can sit comfortably and watch TV or relax in the evenings as the TV is in an annoying location so you can’t really see it from the small sofa nor can you see it from the bed. Also the bed is two singles which come apart often and is highly annoying. Would I return? Probably not. It did the job for the few days we were in Stockholm but that’s it. Wasn’t a pleasant stay.,NEGATIVE
"All ok expecting the smell from the bathroom,verry bad smelling .",NEGATIVE
The only problem I had was carrying my suitcase down the stairs. But that was clear from the description.,NEGATIVE
"We had a nice stay at the apartment in Stockholm. Sadly, the dishes and the bathroom weren’t as clean as expected and the bathroom was very smelly.",NEGATIVE
Great location and quite spacious bedroom. Plenty of clean towels and bedding. Easy to get in and out. Could do with updating the blinds. Main problem was the very bad smell coming from the bathroom. Clearly there is a issue that needs to be fixed as it was difficult to get clean in a bathroom that smelled of sewage. This really needs attention asap. A humble place that when the drains are fixed would be an ok place to stay.,NEGATIVE
Location is perfect and right in the center of old town (Gamla Stan). The apartment however had some clear oversights like cleanliness and dated fixtures/furnishings. Overall it’s not a bad property but you are paying for location. It’s not a bad apartment but for the price it’s certainly not worth what’s asked for. We sent a note to inquire on drying rack availability for clothes and received no responses two weeks even before the stay. Unfortunate lack of host communication.,NEGATIVE
We didnt get Any access code. Very stressful !,NEGATIVE
"The location was great and the apartment was good for 4 people. However, the bathroom was obviously not cleaned. That was Bad.",NEGATIVE
"Quite disappointed on arrival when we realised the apartment is on the ground floor with very limited sunlight. It's not specified on the booking details ( the fact that it's ground floor) and the pictures are reflecting the reality. Overall, the location is good but it's really overpriced for the quality of the apartment ( not very ""homy"" I've it's managed by a private company, lots of signs on the walls about rules and limitations, blocked shower temperature,...). Not very responsive either since I 'ever got an answer from a text I sent.",NEGATIVE
"No response at all, can't reach any person, had to contact airbnb to get my money back.",NEGATIVE
Not a good place for a family or for more than 2 people.,NEGATIVE
You have to pay for electricity if you cook and be ware of a dog wandering,NEGATIVE
Congested accommodation. Not for bang for the buck.,NEGATIVE
The bed and pillow smelled bad that I don’t recommend you to go there at last for a night,NEGATIVE
"If you are looking for an affordable place, you should definitely choose this one. It has great location, groceries right next to the building and it's a few minutes walk on the metro station, you will be in the city centre in 15 minutes. The true is that this is not a quiet area and building, so you are not gonna sleep well (at least I didn't). I don't know why everyone mention some smell, but there was none. It's just the smell of an (I guess) old building. The only thing we noticed were quite dirty walls, but that didn't bother us. There were some guy living in the other room, which was okay with us. She didn't talk to us much, but if you want to stay somewhere affordable, it's great choice, Joyce is a nice and kind person! Thanks for the tea. :)",NEGATIVE
"I didn't like the layout of the property, the room was in between other rooms. But it was clean and quite.",NEGATIVE
Benita was helpful and a good host. The apartment is nice but it’s really loud with traffic from the main road which made it difficult to sleep and isn’t detailed in the air b n b listing. We booked the apartment as it had a kitchen and we have friends in Stockholm that we wanted to entertain however this was impossible as the cooker doesn’t work and the kitchen light also doesn’t work. Overall an ok stay but not the best and expensive.,NEGATIVE
"This apartment is on the third floor of an elderly building from the late 19th century and HAS NO ELEVATOR. Recommended for young people only. The area offers many shops, restaurants and is well connected. Don't take your car to Södermalm if you are not willing to pay for a high parking fee and leave your car in the parking. Further, the building is going through renovation works and during working days we were molested by strong odors from chemical products and tar which must be used for isolation.",NEGATIVE
"Julius’s apartment is a beautiful, classic and very spacious place in close location to the old Stockholm. It’s decorated with a lot of artistic pictures. Old and classy, stylish and cultured. However it’s on the fourth floor ( on the 3rd floor, maybe by official Swedish standard) with no elevator. If you have an older member or someone with difficulty claiming stairs, I don’t suggest this place. There is a big problem with the shower and water temperature. It gets too hot 🥵 at the burning level and it seems there is no cold water to mix it with. You can get serious burns and injured. Surprisingly, for a high level and expensive place, there was no shampoo or even soap bar in the bathroom. We had to go out and buy our own. Drainage was not emptying the shower water properly. Ventilation is very poor and old. The mattress on the beds are too thin that you can feel the springs on your back. There was no blinds on the second bedroom window. Construction in front of the building, made us park the car far away and carry our luggages. In my opinion, charging extra 200 Kr a night for the parking spot for an expensive place, is an overkill and not RIGHT. Again, there are a lot of good things about this place, but these issues should not be there for a place with that price.",NEGATIVE
"Stay in well located flat spoilt by poor maintenance 1. Lock on bathroom door, key was missing, door was locked and we were unable to access the toilet. Host confirmed this had happened before and we must have left the key in the bathroom. We hadn’t seen a key, host was only prepared to send a locksmith the next day, and at our expense if the key was in the bathroom -2000SEK We tried all other door keys with no success and called Air bnb support. Whilst they spoke to host we looked in all parts of the flat and located a key, which fitted, on the second bedroom windowsill When a locksmith phoned shortly afterwards we reported the issue was resolved A non key lock inside the bathroom should be fitted to avoid another repetition 2. The main bedroom light is totally inadequate and the blind in same room is broken in the down position, mentioned in prior reviews 3. Some of the furniture needs replacing, see prior reviews 4. The key safe would not lock, made cleaner aware on depart",NEGATIVE
"It was a beautiful, spotless apartment in central stockholm. Great for a couple staying & up for walking in stockholm. We were disappointed that it wasn’t suitable for our baby with several sets of stairs, bars & strong alcohol-smells in the hallway. We were also bummed that the coffee machine & fireplace weren’t working.",NEGATIVE
"Wrong codes. Filthy place (hair in the bed, ungodly crumbs in the bed and on the toilet seat, pee as well. Broken bed !! The host denied the place was dirty and denied the bed was broken, and erased all proof from the Airbnb chat. Luckily I tooks photos of everything. The flat could be great though, if the host tried harder. The bars and the road nearby are very loud, get earplugs!!",NEGATIVE
The contact was good and the locations is in the middle of the city upon a bar which is good if you like a drink. Also a bakery and a whole sales is round the corner but the whole apartment is worn out. The interior is partially broken ( e.g. door handles nearly fall off). The fridge is not in the best condition and also quite dirty. The toilet seat nearly falls off. Several window handles are already broken off. The sofa has got stains on it. A huge pile of cables is in one corner of the living room. The wallpaper is going off on a few spots. The whole apartment gives the feeling that no one is living here and takes care.,NEGATIVE
"The apartment was in a nice location and the apartment itself was nice. However, the strong smell of sewer gas in the bathroom was so overpowering I would not recommend anyone to stay here until this problem is fixed.",NEGATIVE
"Nice apartment, but not very good communication with the hostess",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is OK, clean and nice. Although we noticed some disadvantages, TV has some local channels only, no Internet connection, this means you can’t watch YouTube or anything. Unfortunately this huge TV-set is useless. Arrival time is 16:00 and you need to check out at 11:00. So you pay such a huge amount of money just for a sleep. Nothing like shower gel or shampoo in the bathroom, by the way. And you need to throw out your trash! Why cleaning can’t do this? Nonsense.",NEGATIVE
"Tastefully done apartment, spacious. As in previous comments, it s noisy at night. Very unresponsive host. Not even a simple ‘hello’ back after you introduce yourself. Check in instructions a bit confusing. When I asked about it, the only words she answered ‘ read the instructions !‘ lol Heard a constant ‘vent sound’ above the oven after using the oven on first evening which got me worried as it would not turn off. No smoke detector installed...so a friend told me I had to contact her to make sure that sound was normal. It was late and she did not appreciate it when I contacted her, sorry but I consider that a safety issue.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is nicely furnished and in a great location if you want to visit both the northern and southern parts of Stockholm because it is in the very middle. The neighborhood is quite noisy, because there are lots of restaurants and bars. They close pretty early but there were unrespectful tourists screaming and we woke up a few times in the middle of the night. Overall the apartment was not as clean as we expected. The main problem is the mess you find in every cabinet or closet. Since we were staying there for a week, we wanted to empty our luggages but we couldn't because the closet was quite dirty (hair, dirty cleaning supplies, piece of packaging...). If you stay just for a couple of nights is totally fine though.",NEGATIVE
Great location and a nice apartment. Check-in was easy. But there are a few broken things in the apartment (a window and the toilet seat). The hosts are a bit unresponsive and the co-host was rude.,NEGATIVE
A bit cold and the communication a bit difficult. Some plates were dirty but beautiful home overall.,NEGATIVE
"The apartment was in such a great location and we had a lovely stay. Upon reading some other guest reviews, I can definitely see how it was slightly difficult to get into the apartment if you’d never been before. Communication on the wifi password was quite difficult as well. Construction noise was very loud in morning, but that comes with the location. The only other downside is that I felt the apartment could have been cleaner, but I supposed that’s one of the trade offs of not paying a cleaning fee. All in all, it was a great place for our time in Stockholm. Thank you, Maria, for your accommodation!",NEGATIVE
"The flat is very nicely decorated and the location is perfect - the flat is surrounded by restaurants, cafés and bars. Unfortunately, the communication with the host/co-host wasn't great - if there was any communication at all. We booked for four people but there were not enough towels and bed/pillow sheets for all of us. After communicating this to the host, there was no reply or reaction. We then tried to call - but the number provided doesn't even function. Staying there when you are 2 people is fine. But if you're a larger group, I would not recommend it.",NEGATIVE
"Overall, the place was solid. However, it did look better in the photos. For example, there's no area rug in the living room as pictured. It was a bit older than expected, but still very clean. My biggest complaint was the lighting in the bathroom. It was very dark. I am a woman & needed to do hair and makeup but could barely see. There is supposed to be a light behind the mirror but the bulb didn't work. I messaged the host & she never responded. If that issue was resolved, I wouldn't have any major complaints about this place.",NEGATIVE
Beautiful flat but sadly very noisy due to the club downstairs. Music is very loud until 3am on Fridays and Saturdays and we had trouble sleeping because of this.,NEGATIVE
"For the cost of this Airbnb, I would not recommend staying here. Although Old Town (Gamle) is a nice area of Stockholm with many things to do, the Airbnb is fairly small and in an old building surrounded by cobblestones. Although a separate issue, there is much construction directly outside the bedroom window all through the day and night. Checking in was rather difficult, especially given the exceptionally late 4pm check in time. The unit was hard to locate, as the buildings numbers are not intuitive and the instructions not descriptive. Inside, there was a lack of household items required for our four guests. There were only two towels and three pillows. Additionally, a non functioning hairdryer.",NEGATIVE
"I really wanted to love my stay here but I was really disappointed. We had issues getting into the building because the codes on Airbnb were not the same as the ones sent to us from the host. They weren't working and the landlord had to let us in because we werent getting help from host. Check out is at 11am and check in isn't allowed until 4pm.. you would think that would be enough time for some heavy cleaning. There was hair everywhere, couches, floor, bed. Floors were really dirty. Everything had a layer of dust on it. We were only provided two towels which felt like sand paper. The bathroom shower has two shower heads and only one works and it gets water everywhere, the main light in the bathroom did not work. Mold on the shower ceiling. No extra blankets or pillows were provided for the pull out couch. The listing showed portable fans but there are no fans. The location is EXTREMELY loud. You are surrounded by restaurants and bars that cause noise 24/7, bring earplugs.",NEGATIVE
It’s a bit noisy as it is located right in the old city.,NEGATIVE
Place was nice. Getting in is a bit of a production. Main complaint is the the TV stopped working and the co host did not come to fix it despite him saying he would.,NEGATIVE
Pros: Great location. Fast and easy checkin and checkout Cons: Very noisy at night. Bad quality of bath towels. No shower gel. No kitchen towels.,NEGATIVE
"We stayed in the apartment with our 6m baby and my parents and I would not recommend staying here with such group, its rather suitable for young party-goers or if you just have lower standards on accomodation quality level. House was not as clean and well maintained as it looks on the pictures. Its way more shabby, and there is for example a massive ”no smoking” sign on the living room wall, which is not adding much to the minimal cosyness the aparment has. As the description says, its loud due to bars downstairs, and that is accurate, so bring earplugs if you plan to sleep. Towels were provided, but they were so thin and small that I would have preferred to bring my own if I would have known that. Also we had agreed to have a baby bed in the apartment while booking, which was not there and needed to be brought after check-in. This kind of extra hassle is not fun with a baby. If you plan to ask for any extra amenities, remind the host before check-in.",NEGATIVE
Franscesca didn't answer my messages and calls and cancelled the booking after the supposed check-in hours when I called airbnb support. It was the most horrible experience I had with a host!,NEGATIVE
Pleasant hosts / accurate photos / but unfortunate start to my stay due to my room being unclean upon check in. It was very disappointing and the initial response to my findings although apologetic were not of any help. After finding more unclean areas I was eventually moved to another apartment for a couple of nights. When I was due to move back to my initial apartment I did a quick inspection before moving my luggage only to find some of the unclean areas still dirty. This was very frustrating as I would have thought management would inspect after a complaint about hygiene. I had also sent photos / info re: the areas so I was very shocked they hasn’t been addressed. I was able to stay another night in the other apartment but it wasn’t ideal to move back the following morning due to work. I met Niclas the manager the following day and he was great! He helped me with my luggage and also made sure I was happy with the cleaning in the room. I really appreciated the extra lengths he went to to make sure I was happy. He also appreciated the feedback. I regularly saw the cleaner so perhaps my room was an oversight. The communal areas in the hotel were very clean. The rest of my stay was enjoyable. No problems at all. As the reception is largely unmanned you can help yourself to clean towels and bedding. I would recommend the basement apartments only for a short stay. Having no windows for a full month was a bit too much although I slept very well. And to add the beds are exceptionally comfortable.,NEGATIVE
"When I read the previous reviews mentioning stains on the carpet, I thought I would find something dramatic, like a body-sized patch of red or something equally worth commenting on. Maybe my eyesight is bad, but I found maybe 3 spots next to the kitchenette (which should be no surprise since guests cook there) and nothing else? I am mystified… Take this room if you have laundry to do, it is very very close to the laundry room (along with room #19). Lack of windows was a big plus in summer as we slept past sunrise. Housekeeping does an exceptional job with the cleanliness of the room and with follow up on guests requests. My only gripe is the mattress - it is quite soft, so not for people with back problems like me and my partner.",NEGATIVE
"The Airbnb was located in a great place; however, William and Sofia were both rude in their communication before arrival. William intruded on our stay both days, once to change a light bulb and the second day to start cleaning before we checked out. We felt as if he was spying on us. It was quite uncomfortable.",NEGATIVE
If you're staying here as a solo traveler. Do not use the extra beds as a place to relax or keep your clothes. You will be blamed for bringing more guests. All travelers should expect William (or cohost) to try and 'stop by'. William will give an excuse and want to stop by. Do not expect full privacy in this Airbnb.,NEGATIVE
"The pictures are not really what this place looks like - it is a dark, dingy, run-down set of rooms off of a dirty and unpleasant staircase. The bathrooms are half-broken, old, and in need of updating and cleaning. There is only one lightbulb per room. It smells weird and feels bad to be in.",NEGATIVE
"Brilliant location, great place, doesn’t have a lounge but very spacious. No issues. Only negative is the app based Bluetooth key. Was a pain. Phone died one day was annoying to deal with. There’s better alternatives to this system available",NEGATIVE
"Very large. It’s not child friendly. If you have children, I wouldn’t recommend. If you’re a few group , it’s great place.",NEGATIVE
Great space. Small but excellent location. It is a thurs floor walk up so be prepped for many stairs. Only major drawback is the new Burger King that was put in downstairs. It ruins the charm of the square and makes the stairwell smell of grease.,NEGATIVE
"Top location and remarkable flat. A bit of a shame that it is in a somewhat loveless condition with regard to some details: water kettle defective, at least 1 pot not usable because not suitable for induction, both wall wardrobes useless because completely loose, several lamps missing or defective.",NEGATIVE
It’s a problem where to hang up and arrange your closest if you’re three in the apartment little bit longer than three or four days,NEGATIVE
"The first issue was climbing the three flights of step stairs and the second was finding the key. Once we finally got in without being able to download the photos of descriptions, we found a clean space. The place looked like the photos but the bed was not photographed well. The bed itself was on a huge slant and the bed needed leveling. The bed itself was completely unacceptable so we ended up having to move the whole room around. The location is great however it’s extremely noisy and one should be advised about that before making a decision. We had no WiFi which was promised and when we spoke with our host he gave us the run around. We never got the issue resolved. When checking out you need a minimum of two people to check out as the gate at the bottom to exit needed a key to unlock it before putting the key in the lock box several flights up.",NEGATIVE
The flat per se is located very central and easily to get to. However the smell (especially in the bathroom!) is extremely strong and incredibly bad and throughout our whole 7 days stay it didn’t get any better (almost like you could smell the sewage system through the sinks and the shower). The kitchen amenities hadn’t been cleaned properly either and some basic stuff (like toilet paper) was completely missing too.,NEGATIVE
"The flat was in a great location in Gamla Stan, not Södermalm. The space is very basic with missing lightbulbs, a bed in the middle of the living room, no washing machine, and an area that wasn’t painted. Thankfully the bed was comfortable, but we had issues contacting the owner to inquire about extra towels and fix the wifi (which never happened). The flat is not managed by an individual, rather by a service who was not helpful. We were given two very thin hand towels and two very thin bath towels for a 4 night stay. We received no towel for the bathroom floor which has an open shower and became slippery. I had to ask about towels and the wifi several times and was told to fill out a form, which I did twice and I still had to explain the issue via chat multiple times. The WiFi box wasn’t even in the flat (or they couldn’t tell me where it was). They did issue a partial refund, but it was a far less than ideal stay.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment had comfortable furniture, functional kitchen and was surrounded by trees. The host responded quickly and check in was easy. The apartment was missing tv channels and bedding was poor quality. The apartment may seem a bit dirty because it had owners personal belongings and food. Overall our stay was okey.",NEGATIVE
"The accommodation is very well placed and the check in well thought out. We were a little disappointed with the condition of the floor in Room 15, which was pretty dirty. We have stayed in this hotel before, I take it that the problem is only with this apartment because the room we stayed before was clean.",NEGATIVE
"No coffee maker in the room. Two vending machines, one for the coffee, out of order. Elevator out of order. Reception never manned. I'm sorry, but we cancelled after one night. Cancellation procedure was great and we were refunded for nights not used without questions asked.",NEGATIVE
"Apartment has a good location with a nice view, rooms are spacious. A little grocery shop and pizza restaurant close to the apt. Regarding kitchen supplies we thought it was a bit strange that there is a corkscrew but not a single wineglass. Although we were informed in advance about the inner temperature, it was worse than expected (and we live in Scandinavia!! ) There is a constant ice-cold draft from all windows and the worst of all is the balcony door that doesn´t close properly. We went to sleep with woolen clothes on. The only pleasant place to sit was by the dining table in the dining room. It´s a nice place to visit during summer but definitely not during the winter. Apt should be supplied with extra heating devices. Next time I will make sure I rent apt from a private person and not a firm. The nice experience was actually an Italian pizza restaurant in the neighborhood.",NEGATIVE
No day light at all because it’s a basement and the stores were broken.,NEGATIVE
Clean spotless room and great location. only downside for me was strict house rules that made me feel uncomfortable.,NEGATIVE
The place was exactly what I expected from the pictures. Location wasn’t ideal for me and took longer to get around than I would have liked. Price was high for size and location.,NEGATIVE
"Beware 595 Kr cleaning charge!!!!!! Lovely neighbours, lovely owner, great location. Broken sofa bed, unworkable features, Terrible management company, disinterested, unresponsive.",NEGATIVE
"The location is amazing, yet I'm unable to provide a positive review. There were several things that made my 3 night stay uncomfortable. I read the other reviews and clearly understood that there would be noise outside the window but what I didn't anticipate was that because this is a first floor unit, that there would be no privacy with the window shade up and that I wouldn't feel safe opening the window. Upon my arrival, it was extremely warm inside the unit but when I went to open the window, I was startled by a man standing within arms reach outside the window looking directly at me (there is a picnic table directly beside the window in the courtyard). Yes, it was warm outside and I understood that there was no air conditioning, but I didn't feel comfortable opening the window even though it was cooler outside than inside. There were also a few other things worthy of mention that I shared with the host and perhaps they will be addressed for future guests. The washer didn't work properly and I had to hand squeeze the water out of the clothes (very messy); there is a nice little kitchenette but there were a few things missing making it less than ideal for preparing small meals... no oil, pepper, dish soap; the bed is very uncomfortable (I've slept on futons that were more comfortable) and the door to the unit needs adjustments (it takes a bit of force to open or close). Finally, the unit could use a fresh coat of paint. I don't believe I've ever given a bad review and as a AirBNB Superhost myself, I take reviews very seriously. I do believe that if the host will address the issues that can be fixed, future guests might have a much better experience than mine.",NEGATIVE
Perfect location but extremely small apartment Shower was not working properly.,NEGATIVE
The location is magnificent however the bed mattress was horrible and the room was a bit too cold even with the heating turned up.,NEGATIVE
"Everything is perfect, the only problem (maybe it's just me) is the bed which is not comfortable.",NEGATIVE
"Sadly this stay was a bit of a disaster. it began with multiple hairs being found in our bed. so many it was quite alarming. it was evident the bed hadn't been changed. secondly the property overall is quite run down. there's a lot of paint flaking off the walls. The cupboards in the bathroom are rotting due to overuse, and the bedding was ripped and stained. the flats also really small. you can nearly stand in it once the bed is pulled out. there's certainly no where for your bags. we had to use the dining table (located less than a metre from the bed) there's nowhere to hang or even put your clothes. so we lived out our bags. lastly, and most concerned of all was the extreme noise both in the communal hallway. and outside. this property backs into quite a noisy pub. every hour, on the hour. the bar staff would pour huge amounts of bottles into a bin, this combined with a number of residents in the flat opposite screaming at random periods really caused concerns of safety",NEGATIVE
"There was a whole long story in the text from the owner about keeping quiet in certain hours. When I was woken by the noise of banging dustbins in the hallway at 6 o’clock in the morning, which was not appreciated.",NEGATIVE
The listing is next to the garbage collection point and the nearby restaurant workers take out the garbage very loudly. Also restaurants ventilation system is quite noisy. In addition - the heating system is electroc heater. Its always cold once you come in and at night its hot upstairs and chilly on the first floor.,NEGATIVE
"The apartment is at a great location, very central. Communication was friendly with fast response times, check in was easy. It was quite noisy though through the neighbor restaurant, without ear plugs sleeping was difficult. Also during the night the heat from the stand heat was rising up to the sleeping area and the ground floor was becoming more and more cold. Not ideal sleeping conditions.",NEGATIVE
Unpleasant host,NEGATIVE
"This man has a camera with a microphone in the apartment, I made the reservation for myself because I was going alone, then I checked with my boyfriend, this man did a show, because he has rules, you cannot resive visits, he treated me like a prostitute, He made me leave the apartment, threatening to call the police, I am a passive person and my place also did not want problems and we left the apartment in the middle of the night,",NEGATIVE
"Very disappointed ! The photos don’t show the reality. Three things in my mind to sum up this stay. Smell of garbage, dirty carpet and disturbed sleep. The entrance door is next to communal garbage place (we can’t say a garbage bin because there is no container. You can just put garbage in the place and close it with red wooden doors so you can visually cover the garbage but all bad smells come out to the studio when you open the entrance door of the studio. ) We could also hear someone throwing away their garbage at any time as well as taking them away early in the morning. Unlike the photos, this is a pretty dark studio. It was generally clean but we have to say that the carpet in the middle of the studio (much bigger size than one of the photo in the AirBnB.) was filthy. (A plenty of stains and some part of it was sticky!) We couldn’t sleep well because of noise and lack of air. (If you want air, you have to put up with the smell of garbage through the door…). The washing machine didn’t work well as we expected ( I think spin circle didn’t work well) so we had to wring the laundry out by hand and dry it with a fan otherwise our laundry would drip on the floor.. I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone! It was not worthwhile to pay 250 euros per day! Very unpleasant experience.",NEGATIVE
The location is great and central to many places but the location of the unit in the building is not ideal. The unit was dark and usually had an odd smell from the restaurant/bar next to the unit and they will wake you around 6 am with clanging bottles.,NEGATIVE
"Definitely pricey, but the location made up for the expense",NEGATIVE
The host is untrustworthy. The place is smelly and is placed just besides huge garbage sorting station.,NEGATIVE
"The place is in the back of a tiny, tiny dark backyard, literally right next to the dumpsters from the restaurants! No chance of daylight or opening a window. This place sucks!",NEGATIVE
"The positive is the location, the bed and the big bathroom The noise is the less positive but is already described on the description The small apartment plus lack of space on the kitchen makes difficult to cook and clean, specially if you spend time on the apartment",NEGATIVE
"Appartment is at a perfect location close to everything in Stockholm city. Host had a great communication and the check in was easy. The appartment itself was quite a disappointment. It’s located next to restaurants and all the noices from the patio came as loud as they would have been inside the appartment. The outer door was a simple old wooden door with only drapes as a cover inside. Would say it was far from a comfy and safe feeling stay. For a business trip a bad choise if you need a peaceful good nights sleep. In the bathroom you could see silver fishes moving when turning the light on. Wouldn’t say that gave any bether feeling of the place. Shame as hosts and location is perfect, but the appartment a disappointment.",NEGATIVE
"Unfortunately the apartment had not been cleaned, and there were dirty towls laying around, dirty bed linen and a full garbage can. The apartment is also located right beside a garbage shed, so unfortunately we were woken up very early each morning, by people handleling their garbage just outside the apartment.",NEGATIVE
I’ve had a quite bad experience. The place is way small than it looks on images. It's noisy all the time. The apartment smells heavily bad.,NEGATIVE
"The pictures for this home are inaccurate. Quite frankly I was disappointed with the accommodation upon arrival. There was an excessive “cleaning fee” that was not justifiable at all. The home was barely cleaned and there was a terrible smell throughout the entire home. Communication upon check out with the host was terrible. I had one guest that came to visit me for no more than 3 hours and the host used that as an opportunity to extort more money out of me. Additionally, I required a late check out, it was no more than a 45min delay and the host again used that as an opportunity to not only extort more money out of me, but was also extremely rude during our exchange. I ended up staying at several hotels after my poor experience again and each one was 10x better than this home and much more affordable. The location was the only positive part of my stay here. Other than that, I highly recommend finding accommodations elsewhere.",NEGATIVE
"Location location location! It couldn’t be bit. Right place and no street noise. Guests should know it’s small quarters, but everything you need is right there. My only complaint is you’re right by the building’s garbage, which includes restaurants. So be prepared for bad odors or loud noises at random hours.",NEGATIVE
"Nice and clean accommodation, but too expensive and sometimes there was a bad smell and noisy.",NEGATIVE
This place is very small for 2 people. The stairs to the bed can be dangerous especially at night and the beds are more or less touching. Sound echos from outside and inside so don’t expect much sleep,NEGATIVE
"Nice place in good location. But we were disappointed that although they advertised a fireplace, when we got there it was not usable. We came in the winter and that was the main reason we chose this place.",NEGATIVE
"Family of four, stayed for five nights. The only inconvenience was that the address we got through AirBnB actually was not the right one (I've never experienced this before with the AirBnB system). The actual apartment was not far from where we expected it to be, but we had already struggled a bit to find parking and unloaded the car when we found out about this, so it was a bit inconvenient. To be fair, Louise was very easy to get hold of and apologised for the misunderstanding, and the rest of our stay was smooth. The apartment and the location both turned out great, and the apartment was exactly as described. We found a parking spot right outside, and there is a grocery shop, take away, a subway station and more just around the corner. We would be very happy to stay here again!",NEGATIVE
"Run by an airbnb company that is not at all flexible with check in-out times. My husband severely burnt his foot in the sauna as it was no where stated that the steam comes from the bottom of the bathtub where you step into it through the glassdoor. Which in turn ruined the rest of our Stockholm trip that week as he could not walk in his shoes. Front door of the flat was tricky to unlock and they ask you to clean before leaving, despite charging a cleaning fee. Overall the place is nice and has a good location, but I would not recommend based on poor communication around the above.",NEGATIVE
"Unfortunately I can not recommend staying here. The pictures do not represent the apartment. It is in serious need of repairs, a lot of maintenance and thorough cleaning. The bed sheets looked like they had not been changed. BED ROOM - bed linens had stains, long hair (black and blond hair) and debris like dirt and rocks on mattress cover - every drawer full of dirt, hair and debris, discarded hair elastics - organic debris (looked like seasoning) and dirt scattered on the bed frame - Futon mattress. Very thin and uncomfortable BATHROOM - bathroom not cleaned - shower not cleaned (hair scattered on floor and walls) - laundry left on top of washing machine - very mouldy shower tiles - broken shower nozzle holder KITCHEN - dish washer not emptied - coffee machine dirty - coffee waste and grinds left in can on counter - sticky residue/debris in bottom of garbage can GENERAL - Many light switches not working - hood fan broken/falling off - floors dirty THE GOOD Excellent location",NEGATIVE
My stay was cancelled by host. Not sure if I will get my money back.,NEGATIVE
The price is fair for the location. The only qualm I have is that the listing doesn't mention that there's a company that manages the apartment. My phone number was given out to that company without my consent and other online information was requested to clearly build a marketing profile.,NEGATIVE
The place it’s not as it shows in the pictures ! Everything it’s old and broken. The place wasn’t clean at all.I will never cómo back to this place . I have some pictures that shows the reality of the place . The bulging it’s dirty even in the outside and the stairs from the building really dirty too. I can’t recommend this place at all .,NEGATIVE
"the apartment is well located and it is pretty much as described. There was no hot water on the first day which was not so nice. in the living room there is a roof window without cover, so it is pretty annoying if there is a guest sleeping there and it is bright all night.",NEGATIVE
"The shower hot water only lasts 4 mins then needs waiting to next 60 minutes. The cold weather in Stockholm it's ridiculous… the dinning area and kitchen have no more lights. When I turn on 100 times. No more person came to help, even the host said I could put the key in the lockbox. They guild kids and I touch the dangers box instead of come to help. The stove was electric and didn't work at all as well. Horrible place. Unsafe, especially when kids travel together. Too much strength.",NEGATIVE
"This place is not recommended. The bathroom is far from the room and hard to reach. Also there aren’t enough towels. You get 2 towels for 3 nights and they do not give you extras. The location is far from the center and you have to transfer even using the closest bus station. Also the hosts watch movies until the late night in the living room so it might feel very hard to sleep with all that noise. Even though it is not a hotel, the price is as expensive as the hotel, so I highly recommend all the people reading this review to use other accommodation ❤️",NEGATIVE
probably our own problem but we expected more. rented this for 5 nights but moved to another place after night one. the 'bathroom' is just awful. don't ubderstand why they just don't renovate. I would not recommend it. Found a much better place for half the money. hope they fix this one.,NEGATIVE
"Read the reviews on this property but I'm about to summarize them based on our experience; a) Andreas is a Host (not the owner) who knows nothing about the property and doesn't seem to care b) the power was out in the apartment for 24 hours and Andreas could not get hold of the owner to open the power cabinet c) There is a TERRIBLE smell coming from the bathroom. We were there when the weather is cold, I dread to think what it would be like in warm weather d) there were items broken and not working in the apartment - Andreas's response; ""Thanks for letting me know""!! Zero follow-up e) Andreas will ask for a 5 star review or to let him know directly if there were any problems - this is a way of helping to ensure that there are only positive reviews. I looked at the reviews and saw that they were very positive overall so the ploy is obviously working f) Yes, the apartment is in a great location but so are many other apartments. You have been warned",NEGATIVE
"Great place and location! Everything you need for a stay in Stockholm! The only negative aspect of my stay was that the host called me at 8 PM, claiming a neighbor had complained about noise. This was outside of quiet hours, and I wasn’t being loud. He later mentioned a noise detector in the apartment had picked up some sound. I had just started playing music at a normal volume when he called. This made me feel uncomfortable and questioned the privacy of the place, knowing there was a hidden noise detector somewhere.",NEGATIVE
"The location is good, the apartment is clean, no complaints about that. However, we didn’t like the interaction with Andreas. At first, we were told that we could check in earlier when we still had the option to cancel. But two days before our stay, when we could no longer cancel, we were told, ‘Sorry, it’s not possible anymore.’ This was unpleasant and caused us inconvenience",NEGATIVE
"I hate to leave a bad review but just want to be honest. Shower was full of mold. We found hairs, spots, stains everywhere immediately as we walked in. The bathroom constantly smelled, think it comes from the drains. The living room rug was actually filthy. I have photos of everything. Andrea was definitely responsive and instructions were clear. However, if you are a clean person, this place is not for you. Left earlier and spent minimal time there. Would never stay again. Sorry Andreas!",NEGATIVE
"The house itself looks exactly like the listing but there were some major problems. Olof was unresponsive or unhelpful on multiple issues. There were no sheets for the pullout couch for some reason. Biggest problem was the smell. The bathroom started to reek after one day and he sent a cleaner who said it didn’t smell which is absurd. It smelled like a sewer. I mean look we were three college kids on vacation, we don’t expect a whole lot, but this was a terrible experience. Only time I’ve ever left a negative review in any country.",NEGATIVE
"Biggest issue with this apartment was that the windows are old and are leaking in air from outside to the point where you can feel a breeze while sitting in the couch. One day it was snowing and we had snow flying into the apartment via holes in the window pane. This is the case for multiple windows in the apartment which creates constant airflow in the apartment. Not great. Secondly, the host did not seem very willing to help with requests since it took nearly 2 weeks to receive a coffee pot that was missing. Replaced coffee pot was the wrong brand and didn't work. Other than this, the apartment is newly renovated and floor heating in bathroom which was a big plus.",NEGATIVE
"We had a nice stay in that place but it clearly needs maintenance. When we arrived it wasn’t very clean, the sheets and the towels had a weird smell, and the light in the bathroom wasn’t working. The place was refurbished in 2019 but not well insulated as you can feel the cold coming from outside and the noise from the neighbors. The location isn’t amazing, it’s not so far from central Stockholm by transport (30 minutes) but you need to walk 10 minutes to get to the station. According to the washing machine, it’s shared between flats and it’s busy most of the time even when not booked. The laundry room isn’t clean at all (hairs and dust on the floor). The check in was easy and so was the check out. We didn’t get to meet the host but they seemed to be responsive.",NEGATIVE
Good accommodations in a quiet area. Easy to get to from the city center. We visited Stockholm in May and the sun rose very early. It's already dawn at 4 am. The blinds on the windows do not provide enough protection from the light and this makes it difficult to get enough sleep.,NEGATIVE
It is the Spanish hostel of Stockholm. But you have to pay for everything...,NEGATIVE
Some blankets were dirty and some USB and lights did not work on the beds. Everything else was great.,NEGATIVE
"Our visit at the Generator did not meet our expectations, the staff was very unfriendly and we got the feeling they didnt know what service was. A big plus for the central location though.",NEGATIVE
They haven't enough coins for the laundry and in Stockholm there's a little bit difficult to find a self service laundry.,NEGATIVE
"The rooms are clean, but dont really look like the appeared on the pictures. overall a bit pricey, just like the rest of the capital.",NEGATIVE
"Decent taking into account what you pay. Be aware, check out is very early at 10 in the morning. They charge you if you want to check out later. Beds are very uncomfortable.",NEGATIVE
A hotel in a pretty nice quiet location. The issues with the hotel: 1. parts of the room were dusty with fluff 2. the heating wasn't working properly in a pretty cold country 3. could have done with a floor Mat in the shower as the water starts to leak into the rest of the bathroom when showering 4. bedding was highly uncomfortable 5. you can only open one window in a room that has 3-4 windows. it can get very stuffy in there.,NEGATIVE
"Staff miserable upon check-in and didn’t even want to acknowledge our presence. After one sleepless night in a tiny broken bed that ‘twangs’ every time you role over, we changed rooms. Not even so much as an apology from staff. The next room was marginally better. No facilities to make a hot drink in your room, very, very basic for the money.",NEGATIVE
"Not really worth it, it’s only ok for budget travelers but be aware that it’s not very clean, bathrooms are small and feel dirty. Only good part is that it is located at central Stockholm.",NEGATIVE
"Dirty, poorly cleaned rooms, horrible “automatic” light in the bathroom that made you shower in the dark every time. Overpriced for the room quality and service…but nice and practical location.",NEGATIVE
The beds are hard not really comfy On my third night the room next to mine decided to party I went down to the reception to tell the problem but no one did anything This was frustrating,NEGATIVE
"The private room was nice and was as described, however none of the many windows could be opened and there was no air conditioning, this is happening in August at 30 degrees, it felt stuffy in the room and I woke up couple times at night from not being able to breathe.",NEGATIVE
"Ok, but can't bring food to the hotel.",NEGATIVE
"It is a hostel so you can't expect luxury. Our room smelled weird (toilet smell) and the bathroom was dirty! There was still hair from the previous guest on 3 of the 4 shower walls (short, crinkly hair). I would not stay here again.",NEGATIVE
"Nice place with friendly staff, decent rooms and in a good location, not far off from the city center. I have to lower my rating due to the awful bed we had. There was something wrong with the metal bedframe, making it emit an extremely loud, reverberating popping sound every time you’d turn over. Apart from that, we had no issues and generally enjoyed our stay.",NEGATIVE
"Great place, but I feel claustrophobic and uncomfortable cause you can’t open your windows",NEGATIVE
"It was ok. Probably we were unlucky, but the bathroom was not clean and it had a smell coming from the tubes. The place was crowded, but the reception was too slow and asked too many questions and personal information. I did not feel comfortable to share my credit card with them ""in case of damage"". It was ok, but pricey for the whole experience.",NEGATIVE
Booked through airbnb and they didn’t respond to my messages til the end up my stay(I wrote 2 months in advance) Hair on bathroom floor at check in and bathroom drain didn’t work well,NEGATIVE
"For a hotel in that location and at that price, it’s odd to lack a kitchenette—no tea, no sink, not even a glass in the room.",NEGATIVE
They have washing machines but you can’t use it at night. I forgot from what time,NEGATIVE
"Clean, nice place for short stay. But the bathing is not convenient as it’s gender Mixed living and the bathroom is really small.",NEGATIVE
"PROs: Generator Stockholm is located very close to the Central Station, a 7-minute walk. The price is probably one of the lowest you can get in the city, and the rooms- I had a shared one- look quite decent. CONs: the bathroom in the room was extremely dirty and apparently the staff did not care at all, as they haven't cleaned it once during my stay.",NEGATIVE
"It was a gods stay in a very central location, it’s clean and all you need for a couple of nights. But what I really didn’t like was that I had to buy a towel to take a shower for extra 5€.",NEGATIVE
I stayed in a 6 bed mixed dorm for a night and I found the place really congested and bathroom is really small. I wouldn't recommend this place,NEGATIVE
Solid nice place but the little charges for a towel and padlock are annoying.,NEGATIVE
Seemed like not all rooms were being used. During a pandemic it's a bit iffy to pack the rooms full. Would have liked to have less occupancy per room.,NEGATIVE
"I cancelled this trip since sharing space with others wasnt my thing, bad smells and lack of privacy, however good value if the only thing you want to do is to sleep and dont have issue to do it with strangers.",NEGATIVE
overall good and economical place to stay. but on weekends avoid 1st floor as there is a dj party and it's very difficult to sleep until it stops. that's bit bad experience,NEGATIVE
"Ok for the price, however the other tenants smelled bad which made me to book another hotel.",NEGATIVE
"hostel rooms are spacious and kept clean. I have never stayed In a hostel that didn't have at least a fridge for guests to use and a common room for eating until now though and was dissapointed by this. I found this rather odd, and the reason I was given was they had an on site restaurant. Most people travelling don't want to eat out for every meal. Having some home comforts is appreciated. The common room didn't allow you to bring drinks or food of your own either which made it hard to eat if you get in late and your roommates are sleeping. the on site restaurant had good music on the weekend. everyone was friendly. would come back again if there was a kitchen/fridge.",NEGATIVE
"Awesome roomates and location, cleanness in the rooms not that satisfying",NEGATIVE
"Good hotel but somethings are a bit annoying — no kitchen, not even to microwave, heat milk, no plates, no cups. Signs say You cannot eat outside food in the lobby or in the room. That I really do not like. Some other little annoyances here and there. Sheets feel like cardboard.. you cannot open any windows so the funky smells from other people in the room become rotten.. paid locker system is a little annoying. Other than that, prime location, beautiful appearance, cool staff.",NEGATIVE
The clean hostel is in central location so depending on what one is after it can be ok. I didn’t like the handicapped toilets in the rooms as it’s just plain ugly.,NEGATIVE
I stayed at the place but it wasn’t clean at all.,NEGATIVE
"Nice location, but as a result it was incredibly loud from outside, and I guess from the hostels own bar. It was also incredibly warm, and I was sweating througout the entire night, which I was not able to sleep a single second of. Better sound isolation and some air condition would help a lot!",NEGATIVE
"Good, but the toilet door has a big gap at the bottom which makes it rather akward.",NEGATIVE
not helpful ... try the other hostel in the center of stockholm...,NEGATIVE
Not for people who need rest or peaceful sleep. 6 beds in one room n it’s little to much of crowdedness absolutely not booking again. Prefer privacy plus less smell in the room. Had to rebook a new one,NEGATIVE
"Vibe doesn’t feel good, small bathroom, breakfast was good tho.",NEGATIVE
"Was nice, the rooms was clear but it is strange for a more youth oriented hostel to be forced to eat somewhere else or buy there food. So you can feel forced to spend more money than you want.",NEGATIVE
"It was clean overall. In a central location. It would be better if there was a padlock on the cabinet in the room, but I did not have a problem. I find it ridiculous and unsafe that they save credit card information at check-in. My credit card is already registered with Airbnb. And there should have been a towel in the toilet.",NEGATIVE
an expensive hostel,NEGATIVE
"I'm trying to contact them because I can't find my camera I'm pretty sure it was stolen or left behind but they don't answer the phone. I do not what to do. I also request a mixed room and it was only boys in the room, you can imagine the mess in the bathroom that they did not clean for 2 days it was disgusting and now the camera.",NEGATIVE
"There’s nothing I would judge for this price! Clean bed linens and a warm bath is all I need for one night as a tourist. If there’s one thing I want to complain, is that a lot of guests smoke at the front gate and the smell comes into the main lobby",NEGATIVE
"I would stay here again. The location was perfect - it’s not right in the center so you can get some well-deserved rest. However, for the events that the hostel schedule they’re quite dull. Even the energy of the people at reception wasn’t that inviting - I’m mentioning this as it is called a hostel, after all. I also wish that there was a kitchen guests could use.",NEGATIVE
"Be careful with your goodies,Someone stolen my powerbank and MagSafe worth £200 When I told to the reception the attitude was like it’s a normal over there",NEGATIVE
"Be careful with your goodies.Someone stole my MagSafe charger and powerbank which cost £200,When I complain to reception their response and action was not good as expected",NEGATIVE
"Cheap hostel, ok for few nights. One bathroom and one shower/toilet for 6 people so you have to be organised !! Breakfast not included. People working here are not that nice in my opinion.",NEGATIVE
"Its like someone let accountants from a low budget airline design a hostel. Very basic and clearly set up to make as much money from people as possible. No kitchen, no food or kettle in you room so you end up trekking downstairs just to get hot water for a cup of tea. Very early checkout which can be extended by paying more.",NEGATIVE
"Incredibly slow checkin, had to add passport info for every single person in the room even as a local, uninterested staff (use the self-checkin, don’t wait for the staff if it’s busy). Beds were not even made when we arrived, we had to make them ourselves. There was an old piece of toenail in one of the beds, easily visible.",NEGATIVE
"I recommend this accomodation as it has excellent location and good value for money. The only disappointment was the level of cleaness. There was some hair and dust under the bed, it wasn't fully cleaned. And the daily cleaner lady didn't do much, only gave us new towels. The card that you hang on the outside of the door asking for daily cleaning had multiple funny phrases for asking for the service, on the contrary neither our beds were made or our belongings tidied up. They could have put more effort in the cleaning service and less on printing funny words for asking the service. In overall, I recommend it!:)",NEGATIVE
"Some of the reception staff were not welcoming. Not all of them of course. One of the days the cleaning lady visited the room only the towel in the bathroom was changed nothing else in the room was cleaned and the trash can was left full. It also gave me a bad impression when there are organized karaoke night there is no one to serve you at the bar. The case when there was someone to serve us at the bar came and the DJ who organized the karaoke, who were hired from the hostel, and asked for a drink that was not provided to him, was refused one, which for me is extremely unprofessional. The DJ was not provided with even a soft drink and it was later found out that the hostel did not pay him for the Event they organized. As for the lovation it was extremely comfortable the rooms were also nice although smaller than shown in the picture.",NEGATIVE
I've stayed at generator multiple times but this time was different at the checkin. the auto checkin systems did not work & required us to fill out long forms after having entered all our info in airbnb. we tried self checkin and the screen prompted us to pay again after having paid with airbnb & the lady at the counter was overwhelmed with all the guests pouring in without the check in screens working. as an engineer I get the push towards automation but this one was poorly executed & made us wait for about 30ish minutes at the counter with our luggages after a day's travel when all we wanted was to get some sleep. otherwise the stay was pleasant and as expected.,NEGATIVE
The restaurant Himli had a small but good selection of beers but the food was just ok. The front desk was not knowledgeable on any of the touristy things to do. But maybe that’s not their focus.,NEGATIVE
"Windows did not open, blinds did not close properly which is especially bad in Sweden since it stays bright outside long. Beds uncomfortable, bikes that are apparently rentable are broken and not available.",NEGATIVE
"Lots of hair on blankets, bed is extremely uncomfortable and noisy, elevator always so crowded, locker expensive and confusing about the position, the higher locker is impossible and can’t refund the money.",NEGATIVE
"The place is clean and rooms have a practical layout. It is NOT pet friendly (they'll ask you to pay a pet fee, but then they ask you to keep your pet locked in the room). Expect a minimum effort service.",NEGATIVE
Unfortunately it was too bright in room and I can only sleep in complete darkness. The shampoo and body wash was too cheap. The bed and chairs were too uncomfortable. They came in the room regardless of the sign saying don’t disturb. It was uncomfortable. I had to wait on the main floor.,NEGATIVE
The hotel rooms are better than hostel. The main issue IS location of toilet in front of bed !! So irritating and unhygienic to sleep in front of washroom,NEGATIVE
"This is just a place for sleeping, I felt they are a little overwhelmed when having too many guests. Basic services are not covered, towels, breakfast, etc. are extra",NEGATIVE
"I know this is a hostel so therefore you shouldn’t expect much, but it’s still scandalous for the price they give you. The bathroom looks like a retirement home’s : there is no delimitation between the shower floor and the rest, meaning everything will be flooded everytime you use water. The bathroom door is not soundproof so no privacy at all. The beds are uncomfortable, and people could see me laying in my bed from the street. Nothing is practical nor cosy. The true scandal is that they make you pay for EVERYTHING and it’s not cheap. A towel, a lock, damn lockers to leave your suitcase for an hour, toiletries… This can do for a night, if you don’t have people who snore next to you (I got 2hrs of sleep max), but not more! Strongly advise against this place. The staff is very nice though - it’s not their fault if the hostel is terrible.",NEGATIVE
for this room you need a credit card...?? Why?? i hate it that the world is changing from human touch to a computer i don t like to check in myself on a computer i prefer staff that helps me. nice stay,NEGATIVE
It was not a very good experience.,NEGATIVE
I don’t want to rate this apartment but airbnb doesn’t stop asking me to do it,NEGATIVE
"The hostel is great in terms of location, atmosphere, quality. It’s a bit pricey but it’s Sweden man. The are always activities every night like karaoke, board game night and etc. No kitchen for you to cook and you cannot bring your alcohol to the common area, which is a bit annoying. Also, the sign regarding the rule of not allowing alcohol is really small and I missed it, but the staff approached me in a very rude way acting like I did that on purpose. They could have asked more nicely.",NEGATIVE
This branch of Generator does not offer breakfast in buffet style just like their Amsterdam branch.,NEGATIVE
"Nice accommodations and nice staff...but do not stay here. Day one some guy barfed in the bar and just lied in it for thirty minutes. Day two toilet broke in hostel room (and I was moved to another room with a worse / more cramped layout, and there was no offer of discount or compensation for inconvenience). Day three was screaming karaoke...meaning you couldn't eat dinner in peace). Day four was a meeting room on first floor that was converted into a private party with loud techno (which was audible in room past 10pm). Well, stay here if you want to party your face off. Don't stay here if you want to be able to sleep or work.",NEGATIVE
it was a cheap and ok stay in a very central location. But seriously! No toilet paper?! It's nice with a bidet. But no toilet paper whatsoever? And they totally forgot about my breakfast order! Had to remind them after I've already waited for an hour.,NEGATIVE
"I arrived to the generator to find it was above a nightclub. The room I first entered was a small mixed dorm. The bathroom is hidden behind a mirror. I felt uncomfortable in the room as the only girl amongst older men who were quite inconsiderate and loud. I couldn’t sleep, so at midnight went downstairs. The staff kindly reallocated me to another room. However I then endured three lots of people checking in the early hours of the morning then checking out early. I hardly slept.",NEGATIVE
"The staff who chatted with me at Airbnb kept saying that I did not have a reservation and asked me to contact Airbnb to say that she had contacted Airbnb to confirm that I did not have a reservation. Even though I provided the reservation confirmation number and the chat record of their staff confirming my reservation before, she still stubbornly believed that I did not have a reservation. It wasn't until I interrupted my trip and specifically went back to the hotel reception to check my reservation immediately, which meant that a simple query could solve the problem but she was not willing to. The rooms are clean, the common areas are good and the guests are friendly.",NEGATIVE
"be careful at the hostel, they are requesting your card information to keep it in the system without any reason, the manager told me that they keep my bank card information for up to 5 years, as customers we don't know how safe this is, we don't know the employees or how they handle the customers' information internally.",NEGATIVE
"Great location, decently clean, helpful and friendly staff, modern furnishings. But sadly it is full or drunk teenagers. I couldn’t sleep any of the nights I stayed - people were playing loud music, shouting, and banging on all doors (including mine) which was also scary as it was 2 and 3am when that happened. Not a good place to stay if you want to or need to sleep. I felt like a zombie during the days as I didn’t get any sleep.",NEGATIVE
No drinking water No bathing liquid no soap no facilities Receptionists ugly face ugly manners no service ask to look for my luggage for two minutes refuse even want to ask police or security come to scare guest customer how can they do this horrible,NEGATIVE
"The douches are great. But the bed sheets are not good, it’s made from some sort of polyester. It gets real sticky.",NEGATIVE
Many entertainment facilities. But everything costs even the locker as well as late check out.,NEGATIVE
place was very expensive according to my previous bookings,NEGATIVE
Hostess was not sympathetic to our pleas for direction and travel delays.,NEGATIVE
"Nice place in good location. Disappointingly abrasive response to reporting a lighting fault and to requesting an additional bath towel (as one per person provided not really adequate for a four night stay). Strong odour, noted in other reviews, of camphor.",NEGATIVE
"Cool modern place, nice hood, BUT no internet!!! Sorry I found places without internet is unacceptable at this stage of internet era. Just like having nice house with no toilet. Ridiculous!",NEGATIVE
"Nice place, nice location but.... Stranger things. The house has no internet and she didn't specified it when we booked it. It took so long to get a response when I booked that I was about to cancel. The second day, when we came back home, some things had change place. The closet door was opened and in the floor there was a half-circle shaped plastic thing which wasn't before we left. It is outrageous thinking that the host entered when we weren't there. In case there is an urgency, you have to ask first.",NEGATIVE
"Host wasn't responsive and didn't receive us as informed. hence i was left stranded with my luggage outside the apartment. hence, would not recommend the stay",NEGATIVE
Don't book here! The phone number of the host is not assigned and the host will not answer you.,NEGATIVE
"Very late check in time, past 5pm Common areas were not cleaned. Lock from the room had actually been removed and so there was no lock and no privacy. Host failed to mention construction in the building right by the bedroom’s window The rest of the house seemed to be under some sort of construction or renovation work . The apartment/room was not ready to be rented out to guests. Misrepresentation/vagueness of the other person staying in the house. No flexibility on the host end, regarding check in time, noise resolution or cleaning resolution.",NEGATIVE
"Sarah's place was not fit for Airbnb guests; it was filthy, grimy and dusty. The dust was visible on surfaces in all rooms and the hallway. There were insect traps in several places, and particles on the bed and floors that may have been bedbugs or other insects. Every window was dirty and streaked. The owners had not even sprayed and wiped down the tabletops to clean and remove fingerprints, germs, dust and smudges. There was a large ping pong table where a proper kitchen or dining room table and chairs should be, and along with dust, it had a handprint and boot print in different places. The living room rug was stained and filthy. The bedspread on the main bed was grungy, ripped in many places, the filling was coming out. I could go on... All of this was alarming, particularly because I have several serious allergies (including to dust mites) and asthma and my son has a weak immune system. In short, the apartment was uninhabitable and I was forced to make last-minute arrangements for a week's worth of lodging, in the middle of my vacation. I immediately notified the host and requested a refund. I took pictures, went through the proper (though tedious) complaint process with Airbnb. I engaged 2 different customer service employees and the result: neither the host nor Airbnb have agreed to refund what I paid for this rental. After much back and forth, the host agreed to refund a $50 ""cleaning fee,"" of all things. Airbnb says it can't do anything more, takes no responsibility, and has agreed to refund nothing. My family and I have stayed in many Airbnbs over the years. We assume the places we rent will be CLEAN and SANITARY. This was by far the absolute worst apartment I've seen in Sweden over many visits and one of the worst I've seen in my travels around the world. (By contrast, the Airbnb I stayed in nearby, earlier in the month, was quite clean and tidy - the standard most adult travelers expect. See my 5-star rating and review of Janusz' place in Liljeholmen, Sweden, June 1-17.) It makes me sad to write this review, because Sarah's apartment is in a good location and has a great layout for 2 or more guests. Consumers beware: Airbnb has refused to take any responsibility for branding, warranting, advertising and serving as a vehicle to collect my money for a substandard accommodation. I am now out $644 for a rental I could not stay in for even one night. I am continuing to pursue my claim with Airbnb and will take legal action if necessary.",NEGATIVE
located in the middle of stockholm，near every resort，totally unforgetable,NEGATIVE
"Don't have too high expectations on this appartement, it's older and not as nice as the pictures show. -The bathroom was not properly clean (curtain and corners of the shower orange and black of bacterias + crawling insect !) - It smelt bad in the appartement when we arrived and when I told Tony he said that we could open the window, what we already did, but this should have been done before - There were big traces of burnt in the wall in front of the bed - There was no light working in the kitchen except the one in the oven - There was barely no soap in the bathroom Tony told me about the two last points before our arrival, but the accumulation of all these previous points made our stay less enjoyable. Aside from the fact that when I reported all these points to Tony he told me that I could leave the appartement and find something else if I wasn't satisfied, I guess he is a lovely guest.",NEGATIVE
"The place itself was okay except for a noticeable smell in the apartment. One morning while I was sleeping, a maintenance person unlocked the door and walked in and claimed that he was there to change the refrigerator (even though there was nothing wrong with it). I hadn’t been notified about this by the host, and only when I told the person to leave did the host text me to tell me about this. Horrible communication. Didn’t feel safe after that incident.",NEGATIVE
"Pictures didn’t met the description on the Airbnb page, the furniture is different than on the pictures..",NEGATIVE
"We loved Stockholm, but the apartment not so much. The location is perfect, however, this is the biggest plus. The bathroom and toilet are terrible, stinky and not clean. The shower curtain needs to be replaced asap. As for the communication with the host, it was far from ideal. We just needed some linen and had to ask repeatedly throughout the day.",NEGATIVE
Airbnbs like these make me wish I had a booked a hotel. This is an apartment that is only for airbnb and as such it misses a lot of touches. The check in/out times are very ridiculous and not suitable to a traveler. There was only 1 teabag in the entire apartment/ minimum amounts of towels/ and not good quality soaps. Shower was a bit mediocre with the handle not working and the apartment was overall cold. The apartment had bare of everything. I have always been a proponent of airbnbs but save your money and book a hotel where things are a lot more convenient and everything is flexible. Also you had to take your own trash out- that was a new!,NEGATIVE
Sound insulation inside apartment is bad. Small bedroom and toilet. Check in and out time is not good.,NEGATIVE
"Clean and flexible, but a bit boring inside. A little worn down. Strange angles due to the building being really old.",NEGATIVE
"The homestay located in the city centre is within walking distance of several major attractions and railway stations. Unfortunately, there are no blackout curtains in the house, and the windows have poor sound insulation, so it is normal to rest at night.",NEGATIVE
"Spacious flat in good location. But door handles on bathroom and one bedroom kept falling off, poorly equipped kitchen (barely enough crockery for simple breakfast for 5), loo not that clean, visible damp patches and damage to floor in two places and smell of damp. Lightbulbs missing, sidelights not working. Totally inflexible check in and out (which was clear at time of booking). So it’s ok.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is spacious (though a bit cluttered and dark) and the location is terrific, but I encountered many problems, starting with the fact that the wifi didn’t work and ending with the host’s passive refusal to do anything about it. She never appeared, despite my pleas for help; I checked myself in and out, and never met Lisbeth. She also reported several amenities inaccurately (no wifi, no kingsize bed). Despite the reasonable price, I would never rent this place again — in contrast to my previous Stockholm Airbnb, which I happily rented 3 times before its listings stopped.",NEGATIVE
"The location is great, however the underground apartment was quite dark and the kitchen not really usable as the whole room would stink without proper airflow. The floor was extremely dirty, paint all over the carpet... not as advertised. Otherwise, everything else was clean and nice. The room was way to warm for my taste and temperature not adjustable... unfortunately nobody replied on my complain. I would maybe stay here again for a couple of days if I wouldn't find anything else but not longer.",NEGATIVE
"the description of the place is really accurate. The only disappointing thing is that the garbage room is at the entrance, so I had to experience the bad smell on my way in and out the hotel.",NEGATIVE
"The space itself was nice, not having a window led to a better sleep although there’s no way to cool the room down if it gets hot. Room is as advertised, a small area with bed and kitchenette. My main problem was communication from the host, had to wait in a park for about 2 hours before receiving code to access the luggage room on the first day. All communication seemed to be pre-written paragraphs and my individual messages were not addressed. I would not return to Niro apartments for these reasons, quick and reliable communication are important to me.",NEGATIVE
It’s not good for big luggage traveler. You need to climb steps.,NEGATIVE
Quick and clean but NO WIFI! There’s sort of a connection but it’s terrible and sometimes doesn’t even show up or get you anything even when you do connect. Is it really that hard to install an extender or something?,NEGATIVE
"Review The location and overall accessibility of the apt is great. Many great stores, cafés and dining places in the area. The apt itself matches everything said in the description. The only thing I would say needs an update is the bathroom. It is not friendly for plus size bodies and makes it impossible for ‘regular sized’ people to practice *basic* hygiene procedures. The wooden door bloat from all the humidity and it would not close after the first day, so going to the toilet w/ someone else in the apt was impossible. We overall had a good experience, except for the bathroom situation.",NEGATIVE
Very small and not the comfiest apartment. I wouldn’t stay here longer than a couple of nights. Shower is near impossible to use because of how tight it and the bathroom are,NEGATIVE
"Transportation was easy to everywhere. The location was very near to around Södermalm and Gamla Stan. The apartment was very small but enough for a few days stay. There is no bathroom, the toilet is located inside each other, which was a problem. The shower head was almost broken and there was a bad smell coming from the toilet drain, it was very disgusting. The middle of the bed had caved in and we woke up all night and our waist was stiff. It was the first time in my life that I slept in such a bed and it was very sad as the party receiving the service. I also received an instruction email after entering the room, advising me to collect the sheets and put them in front of the door, collect the garbage and leave it in the specified place in the room, and wash the dishes. This wasn't nice either. Was it me who received the service or was it them? I would like to ask as someone who actually pays the cleaning costs?",NEGATIVE
"Nice little flat in the centre of Södermalm, great location. Wifi could have been a lot better, quite frustrating at times. Toilet with shower is tiny, but managable. A bit slow service, had to wait four days for a new light bulb for example. Asked for a late check-out, but not even 1-2 hrs was possible (new guests check-in four hrs after check-out).",NEGATIVE
"Really bad communication and no way to check out later. Tiny shower by the toilet. Wifi sucked. But good location, comfy bed, tidy and clean.",NEGATIVE
"Small studio managed like a hotel room in a very impersonal way with only standardized messages which serves the purpose if you need a small place to sleep in a central location, the minimum is provided but nothing extra. The kitchenette is not very well equipped and serves mostly for heating premade food, although there is no microwave. And the wifi is indeed very week as previous reviews had mentioned.",NEGATIVE
Not a place I would go again. The toilet is the shower. It’s a bit sad to see this is even legal. WiFi is so bad you can’t play Netflix on the tv. Let aside making a zoom call for work.,NEGATIVE
"Pros: Neighborhood, marble stairway, comfy bed and size of room good, clean. Problems: laundry as with other parts of property grungy. Cloths dryer broken but discovered adjacent strange dryer closet works after an hour of wasted with the other. Nice touch would be to include some laundry soap. Tile in shower, bottom of door, both ugly and unsanitary. Owner clearly attempted to trick potential guests with photos of bathroom and kitchen which are disappointing. WIFI situation sucks. Simply needs cheap extender for wifi to TV, phones, laptop for traveling.",NEGATIVE
I felt as though the pictures shared on the website did not accurately reflect the room. The kitchen was the smallest kitchen I've ever seen in my life. There wasn't even room for a second person to stand in the kitchen. The shower set up was just a shower head over the toilet so you were crammed in-between the toilet and the sink trying to shower. No AC and no wifi. Tenants didn't follow the quiet hours and were playing music and screaming all hours of the night.,NEGATIVE
"I was shocked when I arrived, as the toilet is literally in the shower - super unhygienic. The neighbours were very loud (day and night). The host is nice, but the would not recommend to stay any night there.",NEGATIVE
needs a lot of maintenance,NEGATIVE
"Great location, but no WiFi in 2023 comes as shock. it's not the kind of thing I'd even look at an ad, as I just assume it'll be present. Also, the bathroom is extremely small and there's no separation between the toilet and the shower. I reckon for larger/obese people it'd be very difficult to shower.",NEGATIVE
"The location of the place is by far one of the best. Södermalm is very trendy and has lots of cute pastry places, thrift shops etc. not sketchy at all! It was easy to get there from Arlanda Airport. That being said, when Elias says he tries his best for the WiFi. It 100% does not work and is actually non existent. Additionally, the tv lags a lot even if part of the supposed to be present services. We filled up his request/problem document in order to address it but he never replied. The shower is basically inside the toilet. And the kitchen is rather small. Therefore, it definitely has to be with someone you’re 100% comfortable with, and only for a few days. The bathroom has lots of hair inside, allowing a rather foul smell and not fast water flow. The rest was clean. That being said, again, it was satisfactory for a few days, thanks to the location and easy check in. It really depends on your priorities!",NEGATIVE
"small but nice,well connected,in a nice neighborhood.The bathroom is so tiny,the shower ""is"" the bathroom,water drains from an opening in the floor,standing up to wash yourself is complicated,the toilet gets completely wet,in fact the toilet paper is outside.The kitchen is very small,but there is everything,the owner's policy is not to leave anything dirty, otherwise you pay a fine.What you will use, will not have been cleaned by the cleaners, but by the guests before you,so no guarantee of professionalism.Fines are also expected if the garbage is not disposed of,and if not all the towels are collected,the sheets removed,blankets and pillows unlined,and everything left near the door.The host is precise regarding fines,he message u before arriving and the day before leaving,very strict on the rules and on the cleanliness,strange for someone who called""human error""the disgusting long hairs I found between the sheets when I arrived! checkin is late and checkout late,u can't leave loggage",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is easily reached by public transport and has some nice restaurants and supermarkets nearby. Checkin and checkout was easy with simple instructions. The apartment is noisy however, both because of traffic and people on the street three floors down, giving the impression that the windows are not up to standards. The sofa looks and feels dirty, the bathroom had hairs on the floor upon arrival, the dishwasher was smelly, many cups in the kitchen cupboards were stained and the bathroom cupboard was too dirty to be used. The bedding was worn and the bed was very uncomfortable.",NEGATIVE
"Overall, this was a mediocre experience. The flat was not sufficiently cleaned before our arrival. There were stains, holes and hairs in the bedding and towels, and the sheets didn't fit the bed. There were food crumbs on the sofa and chairs. The floor was sticky, and we found hairs in the kitchen drawers, cupboards, vanity, etc. The cleaning appeared to have been neglected for quite some time. We contacted the host with pictures, and a cleaning crew came a couple of hours later. Pär said the crew was new and hadn't been trained properly. He was friendly and responsive, but non-apologetic for the condition of the flat. It was much better post-cleaning, but the floor was still sticky and other things were neglected. We were thankful that they cleaned so we didn't need new accommodations. It's an upper floor apartment with no elevator, which wasn't convenient with heavy luggage. It's walking distance from the metro, which was nice, but there aren't many other perks about the location.",NEGATIVE
"Not a very comfortable space, strange lewd artwork make me have nightmares",NEGATIVE
The heater in the room doesn't seem to be working so it's a bit cold at night. All good apart from this,NEGATIVE
"Everything except lack of warm water & weather was good. The water was so cold and we never found a way to get hot water for shower. We did not have the courage to take shower a second time. Also the ventilator in the room was constantly blowing cold weather and the room felt like freezing at times. These would not cause any problems in summer but considering the winter in Sweden, it sucked at times. Public transportation is 5 mins walk from the apart and very useful.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment was in a great location and spacious, but several issues made our stay disappointing. It wasn’t properly cleaned before we arrived. Though we updated our reservation for a fifth guest, the host asked for extra payment through a third-party app. We weren’t told the dryer was broken, which ruined some of our clothes. We were also unaware of a preschool on the first floor, and the constant noise from children playing outside early in the morning and throughout the day made it hard to relax. The host stayed in the basement part of the time and had other guests during our stay. One night, they even hosted live music in the driveway, which added to the feeling that the space wasn’t as private as we expected. Privacy and security were big concerns. Our entrance wasn’t blocked off, meaning anyone staying in the house could access our space. Overall, the lack of cleanliness, privacy, and communication made this stay uncomfortable, and I wouldn’t recommend it.",NEGATIVE
"We were disappointed in this place. It’s not a resident but only operates as a business, and as such lacks a lot of attention to detail. From just one bed made up though we clear stated we were friends coming who needed both bedrooms, dirty bathroom, tv not installed (no channels), burnt out candles, lamps that didn’t work, ripped sheets, broken cupboards, no scissors etc etc etc. There isn’t enough attention given to this place to make a comfortable stay - unfortunately. We did raise some of the issues with the host and got a dismissive half solution provided with no follow up. Great location, okay price but wouldn’t stay there again.",NEGATIVE
Great location close to the metro. A bit too small for 6 people. Not ideal with children since the neighbors complain a lot about little noise.,NEGATIVE
"I had mixed feelings about my stay here. Great location in SoFo with a fun view. Comfortable beds, and it can sleep 6 which I’ve found is hard to find at an affordable price in Stockholm. But we had some issues with the key app that gets you in the building, and the bathroom cleanliness wasn’t great. I’d recommend this place, but hope in the future our issues with the bathroom are addressed for others.",NEGATIVE
"In theory the place was good. Three things left an ambivalent aftertaste. First, the bathroom had sewer problems and smelled bad. Second, whilst we had communicated we had small children with us, the downstairs neighbours apparently had really no tolerance of them, as they complained about them running around pur flat: this is not of course not Elias fault, but when he contacted us I got the feeling he was siding with the neighbours, as it really is impossible to keep small children completley quiet when they move around. Thirdly, despite the cleaning fee, he charged us 18 euros more for having left a couple of cups in the sink and an unwiped kitchen table. Also, the Parakey system locks the door sharply at 11 when you check out, which makes it impossible to open the room where you put the garbage if you don't plan ahead. Also, imagine if you forget something in the stress of leaving - at least 15 minutes should be allowed for those things.",NEGATIVE
"We had mixed reviews about this listing. We stayed 6 days and really liked the location, it is easy to reach public transportation and the neighborhood had great restaurants and shopping. We agree with other reviews that the interior doesn’t match up to the description. It show a bit of wear and the walls need painting. The beds are awkward to get into and the bedding is low quality. The kitchen lacked coffee filters and towels and the window shades were missing in one room and shabby in others. It is definitely roomy and was clean. The instruction to get in was good. It worked better than a hotel would have.",NEGATIVE
"Great location with some disappointments: - blinds mounted poorly - toilet seat doesn't fit the toilet - daily life items missing in the kitchen like scissors, dishwasher tab, kitchen rolle, etc. Given the price tag it felt lovelessly equipped.",NEGATIVE
"good things: place was very close to many bars, food, grocery, etc; transit was very available. The access to the place was easy with a mobile based key. not so good: Bathroom: The bathroom was so stinky (like mold) that we could smell it when in the bedrooms and throughout entire place. It was really strong. We didn’t want to keep our towels or items in the bathroom because we didn’t want them to smell like mold. Bedroom: the larger bedroom had a window shade that kept falling off. And when it would fall it was loud. I see other reviews that mentioned this- it is time for a new curtain. I see other reviews from over a year ago that mention both of the issues but from the looks of it nothing has been done. Overall: It was in a great area in the city close to Medborgarplatsen Tunnelbana stop but with the foul smell from the bathroom I would not call it Lavish… and I would not stay again due to the smell in the bathroom.",NEGATIVE
1.refuse to refund cancellation fee caused by mistake. 2. ask more documents to verificate specially,NEGATIVE
There was no bedsheet for the second bed and the beds were not made up as requested despite making it clear several times beforehand as per instructions. Apartment was quite cold which is to be expected in an old building.,NEGATIVE
"the bedding needs to be reviewed, the mattresses are very worn, we had asked for a double bed which was not respected. the rest was compliant.",NEGATIVE
"Nice and big apartment in the cellar, uncomplicated check in and good location too reach the city even by foot. However, the bed is way too soft. If you are used to normal or harder mattresses you will have problems sleeping...",NEGATIVE
"The apartment was extremely clean and very spacious. As seen in the pictures. Unfortunately, we were quite disappointed with the bathroom. The pictures online make the bathroom look much more spacious. So we didn´t even had a storage option in the bathroom. We were also not completely satisfied with the beds. They were very comfortable, but we deliberately booked a double bed and got two single beds that were not attached to each other. In the basement apartment (without windows) you feel a bit like in a bunker. But beacuse we knew that, it was perfectly fine for us. All in all, the apartment was very well equipped. If you travel by car, you definitely have to plan a lot of patience, nerves and money. Thank you for having us Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)",NEGATIVE
We have to collect extra bedsheet and blanket from rooms of the left guest. That did not feel clean.,NEGATIVE
Descroptions don't fully match and the place was not prepared for my visit,NEGATIVE
"Overall great stay, close to the downtown, clean room etc. The only downside is the trash collection room being open right after the entrance door, which creates unpleasant smell just around the entrance.",NEGATIVE
There’s a club downstairs so it’s very noisy until like 3-4am,NEGATIVE
"Good communication with Robin. Overall a fine room to a good price. However, the fire alarm went off twice the first night, which brings down the whole experience. In particularly, as the fire department did not bother to say if it was fine to go in again and brings duct tape from the fire trucks to ‘solve’ the problems; not comforting when sleeping under ground.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment was lacking A/C, we only had a small fan, the apartment had no windows.",NEGATIVE
"Everything is nice and clean. Easy to go to airport and attractions. Supermarket and restaurant are nearby. However, their staff use their key to open my door suddenly. It makes me feel unsafe and uncomfortable.",NEGATIVE
"the room is suffocating, and hot, no air circulation.",NEGATIVE
Friendly place very close to the centre. Spotless clean. There is no window and the flat is almost underground so if you suffer of claustrophobia it’s not recommended,NEGATIVE
Good for the price but my room was a little messy.,NEGATIVE
"Bad experience when I arrived. The room had poor ventilation. The experience was not good, the location is the only redeeming thing about the place.",NEGATIVE
"Great apartment for 1, but incredibly cramped for two. The use of the sofa bed makes the kitchen quite difficult to use. Host instructions vs instructions at the building are also a bit unclear as we were told to buy our own washing detergent, but in the laundry room there is a sign stating that washing power is free of charge with a bucket of washing power in the room. please note there is also no sugar provided (but oil, salt and pepper are present) so you will need to self purchase this. The cleaning staff were very lovely and helpful when I could not get in contact with the host sometimes.",NEGATIVE
Super clean and like a hotel with kitchen. We had complaints when arriving to the appartement at 1.30 in the night. We were not noisy at all but talking in the hallway. There was also complaints about us talking in the appartement in the afternoon. That we found really weird and exoect it to be because the neighbers are VERY noise sensitive.,NEGATIVE
"The place of the house was great, it was very easy to reach everywhere. But the house wasnt warm enough. Radiators in bedroom were OK , but radiators in living room were not working properly. They werent even warm eventhough we ran them in maximum degree. Also there was an electrical towel warmer in bathroom but it wasn't working as well. ( on off button was broken and not working ) There were only 3 forks in kitchen , which i think isn't enough. You have to wash them after breakfast because there wont be any left for dinner. So kitchen stuff should be more so that at the end of the stay you can fill the dishwasher. TV was great .",NEGATIVE
"Overall liked the stay, but the flat had some issues. It was addressed after I reported it, but when I arrived the window didn’t fully close, a light in the kitchen couldn’t be turned off and the shower had a tendency to overflow if you showered even at half the water pressure. So for those reasons I cannot give a 5 star rating.",NEGATIVE
"SEEMS BETTER THAN IT ACTUALLY IS! The bed is ""loft style"". If you try to go up, you'll have to take a really small and wobbly ""ladder""- the white board you wanna hold onto is not good attached, and would not hold you from falling down the ""ladder"". The bed is only 120 cm or max 140 cm which is why I would not rec the apartment for two people. Also, the bed is not secured on the long side of the bed so that you would easily fall out of the bed. In the photos, you won't see that the couch and pillow is very scratchy and dirty which does not welcome to sit there. One of those chairs next to the table was already broken. You do not see the bathroom-there's a reason: it's very tiny, the shampoo provided was empty, the shower curtain is disgusting. When we tried to explain our disappointment to Erika, she just hung up and her options were to sleep on the floor or on the couch. When we booked the apt, it was no problem for her to have a late check out- well, we had to get out at 11 am.",NEGATIVE
"Beatufiul and cosy, charming, small loft. Comfortable bed and furnitures. Friendly and quiet neighbourhood. My only slight problem was the metro station is not so friendly nor charming and is quite a walk from the house. Using the metro it’s about 30 min to get somewhere in the city.",NEGATIVE
"I enjoyed my stay and I would definitely stay here again. There was one potentially pretty big problem with the app to open the main door of the building not working as the host had input the incorrect date for my stay. This happened when I was coming home alone after midnight so could have been a big problem. Luckily another resident was coming out of the building so I could get in. I can see how a mistake like this could happen but it really shouldn’t. So if you stay here double and triple check the correct dates are on the app to enter the building. Also the incorrect information to log onto the WiFi we’re left in the information booklet on the apartment. That was pretty frustrating and took me a few days to figure out. I mentioned it to the host and so hopefully they rectify that. All that said the host was responsive and the apartment was very clean, quiet and in a safe neighborhood and o would definitely stay here again.",NEGATIVE
"Mediocre experience, flat is nice but wasn't very clean, hair of other people in bathroom, spotty sofa. Also the bedding isn't great, very thin topper on boxspring mattress that has seen plenty of use, nice memory foam mattresses are very cheap nowadays. Last but not least the check-in with the app is unnecessarily complicated, a simple key would be better.",NEGATIVE
"The owner gave us the wrong name of the apartment, and we cannot find the key(the institution is unclear), after got the key we can’t open the door. And we waited too long for the owner to open the door. Management is really bad",NEGATIVE
Strange check-in experience with lockbox location not disclosed until I confirmed some additional rules. Semi-random cleanup rules even though cleanup fee is charged. Some of the furniture not attached properly and is unsafe with children. Leaky toilet and broken bath grille.,NEGATIVE
"We came for an event to Stockholm and stayed for 2 nights in the apartment. The flat is well located and had everything we needed for the stay. The only disappointment was the communication with the host which was automated and very strange. Like for example, 3 times mention that there is an noise detector in the apartment (??) or I needed to write a message that I confirm do not do parties in the flat.",NEGATIVE
"Excellent location, close to everything, quiet (no windows towards street, only inner garden), warms up easily, small and practical kitchen, comfortable beds, awesome shower pressure. Negatives are a bad experience during check-in (cleaning service did not clean on time so we had to wait until they were finished with our toddler), a terrible washing machine that is so noisy you'll think things are breaking every time you wash, and the host could have been more responsive - very slow to reply, never answered phone calls. We also made one mistake - forgot to drop the key off, but we sent it back immediately on arrival home. All in all, we recommend the apartment, it is a fantastic base to explore from with plenty of kid friendly and stomach-friendly places around, shops, and metro stations / bus stations to take you anywhere.",NEGATIVE
Minimal apartment. Good location. The apartment was not ready at checkin time. The living room rugs are in need of a cleaning.,NEGATIVE
"There were a few minor issues worth noting. The smaller bedroom and bathroom boasted heated floors, a nice touch. However, we found the lack of an additional window shade in the smaller bedroom inconvenient. My sister-in-law, in particular, felt uncomfortable sleeping without adequate privacy. It seems to be a common practice for people to leave their curtains open, having the option for added privacy would have been appreciated. One area of concern was the difficulty in communicating with Elias on a Sunday. It wasn't until Monday afternoon, around 17:00, that we were informed of the limited communication availability on Sundays. Clear communication about this policy upfront, even if issues cannot be immediately addressed, would have helped manage our expectations better. We suggest prioritizing communication and setting clear expectations regarding response times. A proactive approach would ensure a smoother and more enjoyable experience for future guests.",NEGATIVE
"I only gave the apartment 3 stars, because of problems we experienced: 1. Overhead lights in the kitchen did not work, only under-cabinet light worked. 2. In the second bedroom (off of kitchen), only one of the six overhead lights worked… and there was no other light source in the bedroom. 3. The apartment did not match the photos. 4. Bathroom shower curtain was broken and in closet, that made it difficult to shower without getting water all over the bathroom. 5. Electronic key for front door “expired” 20 minutes before checkout time, as we were carrying luggage to car, so we got locked out (Elias did re-issue but we wasted 15 minutes trying to figure it out). The apartment has the feel of a “bachelor pad” rather than a home. It was an adequate place to stay, but not more than adequate.",NEGATIVE
"Nice location, close to city centre. Linens are clean in general. However there is no cover for showing room which cause splash all over the ground. Some sockets are out of order, some even loosened which is potential life-threatening dangers. The ‘standard’ check-out time should be 11am but our keys are deactivated at 10am. It was a trouble for me to get into the building after morning walk and breakfast before getting back for baggages. The host had delayed response requiring us to contact Airbnb directly for help which is not desirable. Kind of an unpleasant part of the visit in this nice city.",NEGATIVE
He canceled my reservation in the day whan I come to Stockholm 🤬🤬🤬,NEGATIVE
Big collective house consisting of the owner Caisa and four Ukrainian Russia - haters living on the same flour as the room that I rented. End since my mother tongue happened just to be Russian (even though I’ve lived in Sweden most of adult life and being Jewish by nationality) I had to go hide myself in the basement to be able to hold a video conference on that language. Not good. And no support from the owner on that matter either. Do not recommend for those who wanna avoid political dispute.,NEGATIVE
Friendly person but dirty place because he doesn’t clean so much,NEGATIVE
She expects things to be done that she never spoke about. And she gets into your room when you are away.,NEGATIVE
"The apartment had a unique charm and was located just outside of Central Stockholm, offering a cozy stay. However, there were some issues that detracted from the experience. The glass roof meant that privacy was limited, which might not suit everyone. Additionally, the apartment was not cleaned thoroughly before our arrival; we noticed some concerning details, including blood stains on the bed. There were also inappropriate items, including adult toys, left out in the open that should have been locked away. With better attention to cleanliness and privacy, this could be a much more enjoyable place to stay.",NEGATIVE
"Good location but the place needs to be fixed: the bed (extremely noisy!), the shower (one door was missing and water came EVERYWHERE), washing machine (broken), and one of the stove burners was broken too. But overall stay was fine.",NEGATIVE
Pros: clean; great communication; free cereals; very easy check in. Cons: bed is very squeaky; we were asked for money for late check out which given no one had rented it after us for ages I felt was not good vibes.,NEGATIVE
Room was nice and beds were comfy but the staff was rude and off putting. We did not feel welcome at all and it felt extremely strict. On the other hand the location is good and for your money it is a good value.,NEGATIVE
"Clean rooms, friendly stuff, pretty central and an easy check in are the reasons this spot is totaly fine for one or two nights. Rooms are super minimalistic and small. Price could be worse but it's not good as well.",NEGATIVE
"The room we got was not the room pictured on the listing. The were concrete walls with chipping paint, as opposed to a clean wallpaper. There was no seating or flowers, like the photo. The carpet had stains. The shower floor had some sort of stain, so bring shower shoes. And there was some kind of mold on the wall, so my group and I all developed some sort of issue with our chest (headaches, coughing, pain). Black mold? I am familiar with hostel stays, but for the price, this was too much like a hostel.",NEGATIVE
"Generally a nice place to stay in Stockholm, very close with the central station. However, some power sockets are not working.",NEGATIVE
Nice but very petite place located in a very central place. There could be more attention to details like normal sleeping pillows instead of worn out sofa type pillows and we had to find toilet paper because there was very little in the apartment itself. The main reason for the lower score was because before booking I asked the owner of there is local Swedish TV programs. They said yes and I couldn't find them. Even if they were there I didn't like how they showed no interest in solving or helping with the problem. They just kept saying it is there even after I sent them photos with all the apps and channels on the TV.,NEGATIVE
"Unfortunately, some parts of the apartment were not very clean. The bed cover was partially dirty, there were dirty rags on the sink and the floor was not very clean either. Everything else was fine and we felt comfortable",NEGATIVE
"Apartment is acceptable, but I would not stay there for the next time. Localization (although I slept well, my bf couldn’t, there was a party downstairs and police came during the night, so this is quite questionable); Tidiness - at the first sight it looks fine, but once you enter the apartment you’ll find out dirty walls. I found out somebody’s hair on our bed - that was really disgusting. Apartment size: I understand that this is micro apartment but it’s not really comfortable to wash your face and have all water on your legs after because sink is extremely small. When you take shower water is on the toilet as well 🤨 TV is not working. Pluses: there are soap, shower gel, shampoo, tea, coffee, sugar. One more important thing which I didn’t like - for check out we were asked to clean kitchenware in dishwasher and through away our trash. In my opinion, this shouldn’t be quests responsibility. Especially if oven-tray was dirty before our arrival!",NEGATIVE
"Thermostat doesn’t work. It was set up on 23 degrees. It’s difficult to sleep when it’s so hot. Internet works only on Apple devices. Smart TV can’t connect to the internet, which makes it useless. There is a hole in the window and the host seems not to know anything about it. Location is convenient.",NEGATIVE
"Not my favourite place. Well situated but scruffy hallway with marks all over the wall. V noisy both at night and from 5.45 in the morning. Worst of all, the shower and bathroom and kitchen taps only ran scaldingly hot so impossible to shower, brush teeth, drink water. Won't be back.",NEGATIVE
"Pros: excellent location very close to shops, restaurants, main attractions and to the T-Bana (metro); well equipped kitchenette, easy check in, responsive host, clean and tidy, comfortable bed. Cons: The thermostat seems to be centrally controlled only and with no proper bathroom ventilation the room got very hot and humid. We had to open the windows, but it meant it was extremely noisy and we couldn’t pull the blind down for privacy. One of the window panes is broken which presents a hazard when trying to open/close. The ceiling is very low (at 6ft 2, my husband’s head was nearly scraping the ceiling). The apartment is up a steep and narrow flight of stairs - beware if you have heavy/large luggage or accessibility needs (there is no lift). Tiny size of the apartment means there’s limited space for suitcases and no where to store clothes. The bathroom is wet after every shower and the basin is tiny so hard to wash your face without getting water all over the floor. The constant reminders of rules and security presence in the building also come off as passive aggressive and is not particularly hospitable or welcoming. There was an iron but no ironing board. Note: the listing says that essentials (linen, towels, toilet paper etc) are not included, but they are. Not sure why this is crossed out.",NEGATIVE
"Very bad communication! More polite messages should be written. Constantly giving orders and talking about penalties, problems and possible sanctions. It is mentioned that the building is constantly monitored with cameras and that there are security guards. This is disturbing, this is a daily rental apartment only.. I do not recommend this house as it is the most important thing of our age of communication.",NEGATIVE
"The location of this apartment is really perfect, and the place was very clean. The only problem we had was that the door did not lock. We tried communicating with the host about this multiple times, but we were only given the same instructions as in the check in information, which were not working. This was frustrating because we wanted to make sure our belongings were securely locked inside but they were not.",NEGATIVE
Terrible place. Only good if you are a hobbit.,NEGATIVE
"The place is at the heart of old town - Gamla Stan near all the touristy places. However, the place is much smaller than what appears in the photos. Infact it is so small that you can’t close the bedroom door as the bed blocks the way. There is no place to keep the luggage as well. Living room, kitchen and bedroom’s space combined is the equivalent to a standard room’s space.",NEGATIVE
"Warning: this is not owned by an individual, but by a company that rents many apartments. Check to see if you are door 28A,28B or 28C. Warning: shattered glass window. Looks dangerous. looking up I saw that other apartments also had shattered windows. Other guests have already complained about this in reviews, and the company still has not fixed the windows. Warning: street is lined with outdoor bar/restaurants. It is hot in the apartment so you must open the windows.With windows open,you cannot pull down the shade bring sleep mask and earplugs. Warning: narrow(width of medium suitcase) spiral stairs. Warning: only suitable for solo traveler. Bed is small, rooms are small, no storage space so you must put your suitcase on the floor and it would be hard to move around with more than one suitcase on the floor. Dirty drip pan in toaster oven, lipstick on cups. Bathroom and kitchen sink too small to be functional. No smoking posters on kitchen cabinet and on window. Lots of prohibitions and verbiage in the instructions.",NEGATIVE
"Location was fantastic, check-in was simple and the apartment was fairly well equipped. However, there were a number of issues with the apartment: - There is no air con so the place was very hot. - The blinds could only be closed when the windows were closed, so you had to choose between privacy or fresh air. - One very small, square pillow per person - The bathroom is a wet room so it’s difficult to use the toilet for a while after showering - The bathroom sink is tiny and practically unusable - The staircase leading up to the apartment is very narrow and low. Carrying luggage and not hitting your head is impossible - The top floor, shared by other apartments, always smelt like chip-fat. Not sure if an extractor from nearby restaurants ran through it? The apartment was fine for what we needed and relatively low cost, but I was so thankful that we only stayed for one evening as it was a terrible sleep.",NEGATIVE
"This place is in an amazing location and the host was very pleasant to dwell with. However, the apartment was not very clean in our opinion. Overall it seemed like it needed a deep clean. We arrived and the floors had not been swept or mopped, the hand towels in the bathroom looked like they were recently used, and there was hair and gunk from previous stays. The host did send back someone to clean, but it looks like they only did a quick sweep. There also seemed to be missing blinds/curtains in the living room which made privacy difficult. Other than that, amazing location.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment was dirty, full of hairs on the floor on the apartment and also the toilet. Also, the shower holder was broken. There's a review from another visitor in July stating the same issue so it hasn't been fixed for 3 months. When requested the owner to clean and fix it he said he sent someone to get if cleaned and fixed but it wasn't. After that, the owner stopped replied the messages. No curtains on the second bedroom so the toilet can be seen from the building across the street. Very poor conditions to receive an accommodation for which you paid for. Despite the good location, I wouldn't recommend it.",NEGATIVE
"Unfortunately we were not very satisfied. The location is great, in the middle of the old town. We were rather shocked by the cleanliness. Tufts of hair in the drain, crumbs of chips on the floor, hair and lots of dust on surfaces. Our home isn't spotless either, but that one hasn't even been vacuumed for a while. Living room window urgently needs a curtain, as the company on the ground floor and the neighbor can see in perfectly and can watch you on the way to the bathroom. In addition, the shower rail is broken (everything has already been noted here several times). After complaining about the cleanliness, it was perhaps briefly vacuumed and the chip crumbs were then at least in the other corner of the room.",NEGATIVE
"Everything was perfect, but the communication with the owner wasn't quick.some heatings didn't work",NEGATIVE
"Good location/clean, but all beds are uncomfortable! The double bed is small- top mattress over hangs the lower mattress, so the edges of the bed give way making it impossible for two adults to sleep. The sofa bed is a platform-divided 2/3 by 1/3 with a giant crack--again not comfortable for two. All beds have ill-fitting low quality single sized sheet and 1/2 sized pillow per person. The air mattress---no sheets. Owner said, ""the sofa is more comfortable"" and never delivered requested linens. No curtains in living room to block the bright street lamp outside for sofa sleepers, and oddly the living room also lacks adequate light to read at night. The bathroom didn't have a trash bin, so ladies get comfortable carrying your personal hygiene waste to the kitchen. You pay a cleaning fee, but have to strip the bed and more when leaving--yuck. There is little regard for guest comfort in this apartment. Serious investment needed in furnishings for us to recommend-place could be great",NEGATIVE
"A big one-bedroom apartment in the heart of Stockholm's old town. The apartment looked like the photos, but was a little worse for wear. There were lots of plugs, scratches and holes in the walls, some deteriorating furniture (living room chair and coffee table, plus the tv doesn't work which was disclosed in the description). The kitchen could have used another frying pan but was otherwise well-equipped. Wifi was fast enough to watch Netflix and upload photos from the trip. If you're looking for a safe, extremely well-located apartment in Stockholm, add this to your list. Overall, we had a great stay.",NEGATIVE
"The appartment is beautiful and well located in the Centre of the the old town, but could be so much more. It is not well laid out with certain things missing. Window panes were loose and there were no curtains or shutters in the main living area, which makes the appartment very light in the summer, when the sun comes up very early. The bed is a normal double bed , therefore not very wide. There were a few items missing from the kitchen, which you expect in an appartment. Please also note if you do not like noise , it will be a problem. One is in the centre of the old town!",NEGATIVE
"Beautiful tall ceilings amazing location and decent place overall, but you can tell it’s a rental they don’t care about much. Decor is just meh, glasses all had chips I cut my lip on, beds were uncomfortable and had one pillow, and let me tell you about the bathroom… Hot water took a really long time to come into the sink, not a huge deal it’s in Gamla Stan, but running the sink to get the hot water over flowed the sink onto the floor, as it drained very slowly. The shower made the entire floor wet and the hooks for your towel suck so both towels ended up on the wet floor. Small things add up and could be easily updated if someone who cared lived there.",NEGATIVE
My worst Airbnb experience - without hesitation. Major issues: 1) The bathrooms floor flood after EVERY shower. 2) Half the light bulbs are missing. 3) The half broken GLASS coffee table that’s about to collapse. 4) Being yelled at by the housekeeper at 11:40 when we have a confirmed noon checkout. Minor: 5) Uncomfortable beds. 6) Amplified music down the block till 11pm. 7) No blackout curtains. 8) A total of four small sleeping pillows in apt advertised as 3 beds. 9) No soap in shower. 10) Poor communication btwn guest<>management <>housekeeper I’m in the business and this is a sloppy operation. Go elsewhere. I hope the owner sees this and makes the necessary improvements bc this apt could be EXCELLENT.,NEGATIVE
"I think the previous 2 guests gave pretty accurate reviews of the place already. I wished i could have read those reviews prior to booking as i made the reservation last year. PROS: -location, undeniably centralized and convenient in the middle of historic old town CONS: -SMELLY bedding sheets, blankets, pillows and towels which come in multi-colors camouflaging their soiled conditions. My kids had a reaction of eczema because of it -UNCOMFORTABLE BEDDING, beds in both bedrooms sagged in the middle as soon as you lie down. I had to sleep in the sofa the second night. Bedframe was falling apart and needed to be pushed back in place constantly. -bathroom sink clogged. -shower stall enclosure does not close shut therefore water leaked out all over the floor. Hand held shower head broken. No shower gel nor shampoo for guests. Bathroom door cannot close. -most kitchenware had to be washed prior to use. Counters and tables not so clean and sanitized. -Instructions not readily available or displayed at the premises. I had limited access to international data plan so i had to wait for the wifi password from host -street noise: in summer, windows need to be opened for fresh air, so you could hear ambient noise from the late night activities outside This place could be AWSOME if changes were made. But for what it's worth, I'd rather spend a few extra bucks on Sheraton located not too far away. NOTE: what people say is true: Happy wife happy life. This Airbnb experience was so bad that my wife made me promise to never rent form Airbnb again....",NEGATIVE
"I don’t recommend this apartment, and I rarely write bad reviews. I find that the photos are not representatives of the apartment. The place is not antique, but rather quite old (for ex. the floor is chipped around the fireplaces which make it dangerous). The property is below normal standards. There is mold in the shower, all over the perimeter. The door of the toilet is in a kind of fabric and it is torned and looks like there is mold. There was so much dust next to the heat systems and in the sealing lamp to a point I was scared it would fall on us. The closets are clottered. On our first day of 5 nights, the washing machine wasn’t working. The agency first said they would send the cleaning team to fix it, but it didn’t come. Then they said a technician would pass by the next day. The next day, they said he could finally come only couple of days later, between 8 and 10 am, the day our check out (at 10), like this was a satisfying option! They refund the cost of our laundry service.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is smaller than it looks in the pictures, especially the bathroom. The hosts sent excessive instructions, they even sent a google doc with several pages that we were asked several times to read thoroughly. In the document there are too many warnings with fines. At the time of checkout we were asked to follow many steps and tasks that weren't clear at the time of reservation. The location is amazing, but we didn't feel comfortable and wouldn't come back.",NEGATIVE
"If you are looking for a decent prized place to sleep for a couple of nights it does it's job and the location is great. But: - The bed was broken with the bedframe not being screwed to the wall, which made the bedside table unusable. - not enough toiletpaper - wifi didn't work and also not the tv - the sewage smell from the toilet more or less made the whole room smell quite bad at all times. - fridge was very loud (43 dB), also during the night.",NEGATIVE
"Quite neat, great location but bathroom had issues and heating was sometimes non-existent. Internet didn't work very well either as it was through the whole building.",NEGATIVE
Elias place was in a good location and easy to get to and from the train station. It was quite cold in the apartment and did not warm up over the two days we were there. The heater is trapped behind the broken headboard and curtains so no heat could get into the room. Wifi only worked in half the apartment and there cleanliness was a 5/10. Elias was friendly and responsive but we were disappointed in the quality of the stay.,NEGATIVE
"Not somewhere I would stay again. The communication was not friendly and more so we felt that we were being looked down on. After booking and paying for the place we were faced with a litany requests for personal information, including our social media profiles. To too this off, the bathroom was a total let down, the toilet , wash basin and shower were all crammed into a small space. A space so small that two people couldn’t fit in there standing. After showering we couldn’t use the toilet or wash basin after, due to everything being wet. We paid for cleaning in a figure of some 48 USD when we booked and yet our instructions on check out was to basically clean the whole place ourselves. The washer and dryer situation was terrible. Dryer doesn’t dry clothes. The laundry room was located underground and was cold. Had to do laundry full dressed ad though i was headed out and even then it was still cold. Overall I would not recommend.",NEGATIVE
"Good place, but don't expect a TV. Elias refused to provide the remote to the TV in the room when we asked for it, so we could not turn the TV on.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is well-situated, close both to Mariatorget and Slussen station. It takes less than 5 minutes to get to the central station from either of these. The room itself is nice and clean, however the bathroom is a bit annoying. I’d give this airbnb a positive rating, if not the rules the host makes. Some of them are really weird, for example having to send a photo of your ID and a link to your facebook profile, even if you’re already verified on the airbnb app. It seems off and unnecessary.",NEGATIVE
"It‘s just an old hotel turned into an airbnb. From the pipes in the bathroom occured a disgusting smell like rotten eggs, so it made using the toilet/shower/sink extremely unpleasant. Though, the location was great and check in very simple.",NEGATIVE
"The place was okay for the price, but the bathroom had a horrible smell and the host just felt like everything wrong with Airbnb (not someone's home your staying in but a place in some hotel-esque building that someone gets you in and is detached from)",NEGATIVE
"Elias was a very responsive host who provided clear directions for check-in / check-out, however the apartment left something to be desired for the price tag. The apartment had a noticeable and terrible smell, exacerbated by a dirty bathroom. The dryer downstairs does not work, so beware if you need to wash clothes. Finally, prior to my check out time, a maintenance worker opened to the door to my room without my consent, scaring me and leaving a terrible last impression of the place.",NEGATIVE
Overall a nice place to stay. There is a major downside which is charging cleaning fee and asking you to do some cleaning to avoid extra charges. That’s intolerable.,NEGATIVE
I think it needs a new one The exhaust fan is not working in the toilet and the toilet is small so you can't enjoy it well The floor makes noise when you walk on it also you can hear someone when they walk by or pull the The toilet and the bed are very soft I’ve got back pain,NEGATIVE
"Overall reponsive host, good location and really nice elevator. But the toilet is combinated with the Shower and it's not confortable.",NEGATIVE
"Simon's apartment is close to the centre. The apartment looks bigger than in the photos. The labyrinthine basement has a great, big laundry room. Big plus= In the apartment there is a coffee machine. Too soft a bed, which is falling apart in the middle. Simon lives in an apartment all the closets are full of stuff. Even the kitchen cupboards had no room for my food. That's why I felt like an intruder and unwelcome. I believe that Simon will fix it so that the price for accommodation corresponds to what he offers.",NEGATIVE
"We had booked a master room with 2 queen sized beds & upon arrival, received a room with 3 twin sized beds & a roll out bed. Breakfast was to be included which was one of the reasons we booked, but was also not available. The location was nice but was very disappointed when we didn't receive what was booked for.",NEGATIVE
"Overall a good place to stay, the staff was friendly and the room was as described and shown in the pictures. However, there was an unpleasant smell around the bed and some stains on the towels given to me which is why I can't give a 5 star rating.",NEGATIVE
"It was ok place, but I would not like to come here again",NEGATIVE
"Late check-in, early check-out. I arrived during the check-in time 4pm, the room was not cleaned yet. I have to wait outside for another 1 hour and half while the staff is cleaning. In the morning, as soon as I wake-up I was reminded by an email asking me to check-out by 10 am. Towels are supposed to be clean but has smell, not totally fresh.",NEGATIVE
"This Airbnb was in a very convenient location and, for the most part, was as described. Other visitors had mentioned the loud street noise and heat in the summer as inconvenient; however, we did find both of these things quite painful. If you book, I would also advise asking the hosts any questions you have pre-arrival, as we had difficulty getting a response to a question once we had checked in. Overall, for the price, this apartment was adequate, but I wouldn't stay again!",NEGATIVE
"Apatment met description. Apartment was beautiful. As a downside, the host did not answer to our message regarding an urgent matter.",NEGATIVE
"the location and the apartment is great, but the sheets from one of the beds smelled terrible. the host was a bit rude when asking for some extra time to do the check out, not flexible...",NEGATIVE
Very nice place. My only negative feedback is that check in at 4pm is too late and check out at 10am is too early.,NEGATIVE
The place is way too small for five adults. We had to rent another apt that was much much larger and $100 per night cheaper on the day we arrived.,NEGATIVE
"Location is perfect to explore the Old Town. The only good thing. It’s only good for 2 adults and 1 child. Too small for more and cramped. Beds are the worst I’ve had in an AirBnB. Had to sleep sideways to avoid the sloping and the sheets were only over the mattress topper, which was too small. Washing machine leaked and after complaining was told it needs maintenance. Dishwasher didn’t work and no toaster or frypan provided. Three frypans were then brought and none worked with the induction stove. Told the host about this. Not enough storage or hanging space and bathroom is so small, I can’t even describe it. Over head shower was totally useless and the handheld one is anchored at waist level. Overall, not well set up with the basic things or for comfort. Will definately not stay again.",NEGATIVE
"The place was clean and the location was good, full of tourists though. The apartment was very hot and the host never replied us on how to use the air conditioning (it appeard not to be working). The washing mashine leaked water to the floor and nobody came to check the situation, even though we were told so. The beds were also extremely uncomfortable. Overall the place was nice and tidy, but the communication with the host was very poor and they were not helpful at all. I expecially don’t recommend booking during hot summer months.",NEGATIVE
"Beautiful location and tidy apartment. Host was inflexible with check in times despite the apartment being ready, which was frustrating.",NEGATIVE
"We enjoyed our stay in Stockholm in Elias accommodation. It looks exactly like on the pictures so you know what to expect. There were a few things I wasn't too happy about that would have made our stay a 10/10. The worst was unfortunately the mattress. It was soooo soft that we easily sinked half a meter into it. For a 5 night stay it got definitely more and more uncomfortable with every night. Would recommend to switch it to a medium soft mattress. Furthermore there was no kettle and no coffee even though there was a coffee machine. I find it quite unhandy to buy a new pack of coffee for 4 days. Also there were no recommendations for activities or restaurants written down, which if often to find in airbnbs. The flat was clean and everything else was there, so besides the things I said we didn't miss anything. The area is good located with a bunch of cafes and restaurants around. Would recommend but only for a shorter stay.",NEGATIVE
Digital keys have risks associated with their use and ours in effect checked us out more than 1 hour early and we could not get in to get our bags after going out for coffee. We had a train to catch and no way of getting in. Elias communication was typically good but when I needed rapid response it was slow to come and hence stressful,NEGATIVE
The flat was big and the living room and kitchen were very nice but the absence of any blinds upstairs in the bedroom was a real problem and also the bathroom is more a toilet with a shower than a real bathroom. Given the pictures and size of the flat I wasn’t expecting such a small bathroom - too small for 4 people.,NEGATIVE
"We liked the interior layout, furniture and excellent condition of the place. We still wonder why some of our questions remained unanswered, such as our request for an additional mattress. One of the six guests did not have a mattress on her bed base and we have yet to understand why. The kitchen is still poorly equipped, despite feedback from earlier guests. For example, it lacks a large bowl for salads. The contrast between the large number of glasses and the limited cutlery for six is striking. That said, we have very much appreciated the additional equipment our host provided, such as the large frying pan. That was very kind from our host.",NEGATIVE
"The localisation and the appartement itself was great. However when renting a flat early December you expect to have a good heating, that was not the case: no heating and long delays when messaging the host. They sent a handyman however the problem wasn't solved. We slept in great but a cold appartement...",NEGATIVE
"The location is good . The house is in three floor. After that , you still have to go up one floor inside the house to get to living area. The stairs are very narrow. It is very difficult to carry luggages upstairs. The heating system is not good enough that we have to wear the coat to keep warm. Also, the induction hub is not working . We told the owner these problems and did not get helpful solution. Besides, the taxi can not drive near the house to pick us up so we have to carry heavy luggage on the rocky road to Gamla Stan metro to take taxi.",NEGATIVE
"Unfortunately we were NOT at all satisfied with our visit. The flat is nice and situated perfectly in the city centre, but the price reflects that - that is what you pay for. We had the same unpleasant experience as other people here already wrote. When we got to the appartment, the heating in the upper part was not at all working (with -10° outside, this was very uncomfortable). We wrote Sofia all about it, asked for advice or assistance with the heating, provided her with photos plus a description of error signs on non-working thermostats. She responded quickly, but only in Swedish, not providing us with any solution, only saying everything is as it should be. I am not sure she understood the issue propperly when we wrote in English (although English is stated here as a language she speaks). Additionally, we had to buy our own toilet paper, because we almost instantly ran out. I wrote Sofia about this issue too, but she went on radio silence, not responding any more. Do not recommend",NEGATIVE
Came back from dinner to realised the attic rooms heater are not working well with error message showing and water heater is not working despite waiting since check in. Texted host at 6:03pm and no further help was given till we got help from Airbnb support to contact them. Water heater issue was resolved around 9:15pm when host replied but everyone had gone to bed without a shower due to exhaustion from the earlier flight.,NEGATIVE
"I definitely wouldn't recommend staying here if you're sensitive to the cold! I came here with my family for my mum's birthday. The apartment has a good size and a good location, but it was very very cold. We had to layer up to sleep and were still freezing. Elias quickly replied to our messages, but his answers were standard replies and not very helpful. Otherwise the flat was very clean and had most of what you'd expect from the listing. When we needed extra information, for example where to store our luggage before checkin, Elias was very helpful. They do ask you to strip the beds, bring together the trash, and gather all towels before checkout, so keep this in mind when planning your time. Also, they asked for a lot of extra identification (IDs and social media), which shouldn't be necessary considering airbnbs identification verification.",NEGATIVE
Probably the best location outside of the city. Train right next door. Safe streets. Grocery store close by. Only downside is there needs to be instructions on how to work the washer/dryer and oven/stove. As an American I had no idea what the buttons meant and even my Swedish friends were lost. The dryer options are only 2 buttons and doesn’t give you option to customize time to shorten it. Only lets you add more time. Other than this is I’d provide paper towels but was told paper towels aren’t used in Sweden. Rags are. Despite these two things I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SPOT,NEGATIVE
"The apartment was nice, and the bed was comfortable. It was quiet, which I appreciated. However, some things felt unnecessary, like the vacuum cleaner and the oven. For short stays, a hairdryer and a microwave would be more useful. I also couldn’t find a frying pan, only a small pot. Cleanliness was an issue, with strange stains on the walls and a lot of dust. The shower drain was clogged, but they fixed it. The sink remained blocked, and the washing machine had an unpleasant smell. The toilet sometimes kept running after flushing. There was also a smell of trash in the building, possibly due to the garbage chute, but thankfully, it didn’t affect the apartment itself. Despite another cleaning, the stains on the wall remained.",NEGATIVE
Apartment was super dirty when we arrived. Had to go out and walk around for three hours until we could access it. On the day of checkout a man came knocking 5 minutes after the checkout time and refused to wait and just walked in among our things as we were packing our last things. Ok apartment in good location. Cigarette smell on arrival.,NEGATIVE
This wasn't a good experience for me. The place wasn't stocked. The bed sheets didn't smell clean. The shower drain smelt. Guys working on building with loud drills at 7am. Good location.,NEGATIVE
"We stayed for 3 nights. The instructions to find the apartment were clear, we had a little bit of trouble finding the right door (very small apartment numbers on the top corner of the door). The apartment was clean, but is very old. Especially the bathroom. Everything was neat and the bed was good. The only thing we didn’t like was that we had to keep the sofa in sleeping bed position and so we had to sit on the mattress without cover, that didn’t feel nice and the sofa looked a bit dirty. The location is very very good, near metro station and bus stop. There are nice restaurants en cute shops nearby. The kitchen is not fully equipped, we missed a kettle. But we managed to cook there for 2 nights. Overall quite a good stay, but a little bit on the pricey side for what you get. I think with little adjustments the apartment would look nicer! For a short stay, it is fine.",NEGATIVE
"An uncomfortable experience which left us feeling exploited. Don’t go there. Two reasons why not: 1. The photos and description of this flat do not give an accurate impression of it. In reality, it is shabby, cold, and minimally equipped. There are hardly any kitchen utensils, no microwave, one lumpy pillow per person, a stained rug, chipped paintwork…etc. 2. Fredrik was not helpful either. When I mailed him during the week to say we were cold, he sent his ‘driver’ with an extra duvet. Apparently, it was impossible to adjust the heating. When I couldn’t find the other half of the stick mixer, he wrote ‘it should be somewhere in the kitchen’. It wasn’t.",NEGATIVE
"For a first time using airbnb, I was pleasantly surprised. However, the house is not super isolated from the cold. The heaters in the house provide warm, if you use warm clothes you will be fine. My big problem was that the heater in the bedroom was not working, and, although the host had a small radiator in the room, I felt extremely cold. The host provided 2 duvets that were very warm and allowed me to sleep comfortably, but leaving the bed was not pleasant. I also noticed that the matress and pillows were clearly used by a lot of people with stains and yellow color. On the plus side, the hosts provides cleaned and ironed bed linen and towels (face, body) and a mat for the bathroom. The kitchen has every essencials (salt, pepper, pans, cleaning supplies), the living room is very comfortable, with a blanket and 2 couches. There is no tv. It is very central, with transports. The host is helpful. Overall, if you stay for a few days this is a good house to stay in!",NEGATIVE
"Very bright and fresh apartment in the upper floor. I wish anyway my host had not ask me for my private social network account (and the one of my friends) several times before arrival, we found that a bit intrusive, and this created an incomfortable situation as we were afraid the reservation was going to be cancel because we refuse to give them.",NEGATIVE
"Clear instructions about directions and check in, clean place. Unfortunately it is above a restaurant/bar or two and was super loud until midnight or so. Not bad for the location, but bring earplugs!",NEGATIVE
Nice and cozy place. Enjoyed the stay. The airbnb is easy to find and located right besides a bar. Unfortunately the bar staff was pretty loud every morning as they trashed the rubbish and sorted in new deliveries - the windows are very thin. William told me that this is not allowed and shouldn't happen. I would still recommend the place.,NEGATIVE
"The location of the house was great. The owner responded quickly. But the house was much smaller than we expected and it does not have suitable accommodation for 4 people. The bed in the living room is very uncomfortable, I injured my shoulder the night we slept. The shower was ridiculous. The house always smelled bad, I think it was because of the restaurants downstairs. The price was expensive compared to our previous experiences.",NEGATIVE
"the host was very kind and she answers quickly. the location is quiet and near bus and underground stations and also near the city center. if i'd to say something, it's a basement, so it's not very enlighted, not suitable for elderly people and for the ones with motor disabilities, due to its entrance.",NEGATIVE
"Pictures aren't representative - the flat is extremely dark even on a bright and sunny morning, and there is no ventilation and no open windows, not unless you leave the front door open. The front door is extremely finicky and bothersome to lock, and the bathroom effectively floods completely when you shower because the curtain does not extend to the floor. The flat also does not appear to actually be anyone's house, but a commercial rental. Communication with the hosts was easy and they were helpful but also clearly employees, so there is absolutely reason to not hold the flat to a higher standard.",NEGATIVE
"Very clean and well located appartement. The sofa bed is not comfortable enough, only the double bed can be used.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is in a very nice location, however is not suited for a longer stay. As there is no proper kitchen and the rooms are cery dark as it is underground. We had some problems checking in as the key was not accessible and had to wait long in the cold to get help. This was a pitty.",NEGATIVE
"We were most uneasy regarding the exit facilities in case of a fire. Only escape was the front door. There was one other door marked ´escape door’. However, it was firmly padlocked, The windows were unreachable as the flat was not ground floor as advertised but lower ground floor. The bathroom floor flooded with each shower and took a few hours to dry, hence leaving us without toilet access for a considerable time - unless we walked in barefoot. Regards, Inger FC",NEGATIVE
"Nice basement apartment and comfortable, well located in Stockholm City. Getting into it is probably the most difficult issue because you have to take downstairs which does not have any railings to help going in or out. In our experience, we did not have a kind response from the co-host who contact us. Coffee maker machine didn't work, cleaning implements and supplies were absent and we request for them with no positive response. The bathroom door doesn't shut because it is very old and the lock is also broken. So we have to managed to close it with a chair. There is no kitchen nor place to heat up some milk or make a quick soup. It is supposed to be a kitchenette but it isn't. I only a sink, a microwave, an electric kettle and a hotel fridge very small. And that's it. On the other hand, the place is nice, no windows but a great TV set and comfortable couch.",NEGATIVE
"Great location, lower ground floor flat that offers good accommodation for a short stay in Stockholm. However slightly disappointed by sofabed in need of replacement and bathroom that floods with every shower as drain is not placed at the lowest point. Doesn’t prevent a good stay but should be known before booking.",NEGATIVE
Needs refurbishment in the bathroom. The cleaning was poor,NEGATIVE
"It was so bad that I got refunded by airbnb. I left after my first night because the place is unsafe. The apartment pictures have been photoshopped with light and clouds and even if the entrance is on the ground floor, you have to open metallic curtains and struggle your way down to the basement with obviously no light. In case of problem you can't exit the apartment and the emergency exit is locked. The place itself looked dirty, there was hair in the clean bedsheets, and water inside the kitchen cabinet plates and bowls. Can't tell if it's from cleaning of humidity. Prior to my arrival, I wrote to the host several times to tell them that airbnb was automatically translating the messages and the instructions to get in were not clear. They copy pasted me 3 times the same message - unclear then. After 45 minutes inside the courtyard where I got the keys, (host was obviously not answering even if I mentioned it wasnt clear) that neighbors came to help and took me to the basement.",NEGATIVE
Host asked some weird ass questions,NEGATIVE
"The apartment was very well located, but in a very old building where you can hear the neighbours. The so-called rule to keep it quiet after 10PM is bullshit because the whole building is partying during the night. There are very few amenities provided, I was given only 1 set of towel (hand and body towels) for a 9 days-stay.",NEGATIVE
"This was unfortunately the most over priced room we have ever stayed in. This space was barely suitable to fit even one person, let alone two. There was a bad smell as soon as we walked in. The pillows that the host gave us were worse than airplane pillows and the extra pillows had white stains on them. When we asked for additional pillows, the request was rejected. There was not a real mattress, it was just a thin mattress pad and the bed was indented. To get into the bathroom, you need to walk sideways and the bathroom door was broken. We understand that pricing changes with demand, but what we paid for this was ridiculous. Very disappointing stay.",NEGATIVE
"very small; I do understand that everything in that part of the city is very small. But this is a bad place; I would have stayed there if I had known. The toilet stuck literally the sewers because they made a hole for the sink to go into the shower drain; I had to sit on the toilet to use the shower. The kitchen was too small; it was impossible to cook there. The stove fan blew air into the apartment, so the smell of your food lingered forever. The worst ever, there was no Wi-Fi included, and I had to pay a high price for minimal internet access Pros: Good location Very bright Easy check-in Good, useful instructions Very clean Cons: Awkward bathroom layout Kitchen too small to cook in Useless stove fan circulated No wifi",NEGATIVE
"Aside from the mold smell in the bathroom, the property is fine. The thing that bothers me about this listing is instead the fact that the host poses as an individual and tries to make you feel like this is “his home” when this is clearly a business with a stock photo of “Elias” (you can reverse image search to see the photo used all over the internet) It’s also a bit frustrating that they are a bit annoying with their threats - there is supposedly a “decibel monitor” hidden somewhere in the apartment to monitor noise, and if you are too loud, a security team will be deployed at your expense. Just nonsense. It’s mentioned in the ad, but our room did not match the photos, which is just comes off to me as lazy, especially for a property management company. Again - the apartment was okay, I was just left with a bad taste in my mouth after a disingenuous customer experience.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment was clean but quite small, particularly the bathroom. The elevator is located directly opposite the apartment, which can be noisy at night and in the morning. Not recommended for light sleepers.",NEGATIVE
"Good location, and nice place for the price. However, the WiFi was extremely slow. And the pan provided does not work with stove. Unfortunately, after raising these issues during our stay, the host did not provide a solution.",NEGATIVE
"ACHTUNG! ATTENTION! It's a scam! Don't book it! She tried to scam people before,that's why she was kicked out of the appartment. It's now rented to a total other person. I also reported it to AirB&B. Sad that the offer is still online!",NEGATIVE
"Really strange experience - I didnt have any issues with the hosts during the stay and found the apartment pleasant however afterwards I received a notification from Airbnb that the hosts are claiming I damaged the property by dying my hair in the shower (I dont even dye my hair) which left black marks on the tiles - something which clearly shown in the photos is black mould. They are now demanding I pay £700 to repair the property which is ridiculous. They also complained that the cleaning wasnt good enough however there was no bin in the kitchen or instructions where to dispose of the trash so I left two bags of trash behind which they found outrageous, and I quote ”they found face masks, fake eyelashes and contact lenses when cleaning”. Also commenting that I left an ”unusual amount of trash for one person” which is strange as its none of their concern. I stayed in various airbnbs throughout my years and I can admit I dont do a deep clean but do a rough tidy of the space when I leave. I would suggest that they charge a cleaning charge if it really bothers them to do a basic clean up after their guests. If they would simply ask for a cleaning charge I would have accepted that however to claim that I damaged the property with hair dye when I dont even dye my hair and its clearly black mould/something else is false claims.",NEGATIVE
It was fine but there’s an ant problem,NEGATIVE
"Smaller than I expected, not clean, there was a door that connected the room to another apartment, it was locked, but was weird... overall didn't like it much.",NEGATIVE
This apartment is very cold with windows that don’t close well enough to keep you warm and without an option for heat. There’s no proper fire for cocking. We definitely didn’t enjoy our stay there.,NEGATIVE
"The apartment is old but the location is good, refrigerator and the floor is very noisy, washing room is small and lack of fresh air. The landlord asked lots of private info to ""prove me and my friends are good enough"" but he did not share any personal info of himself, which is very unreasonable since he has no way to judge people by gender, career, or race?",NEGATIVE
"This place is a great stay for two people for a few days. We faced some problems with the heating and the extra linen for the third person. There is a door in the bedroom that was closed shut and we thought we shouldn’t open. When the cleaning lady came, she opened it only for us to find an extra comforter and electric heaters there. The host didn’t inform us of this door. Also the neighbours were pretty loud at night and early in the morning, which disrupted our sleep. Apart from this subtle difficulty, the place is very cute, clean and the check in and out was very easy for us.",NEGATIVE
"Overall average place. Instructions to find key weren’t the clearest as there’s several lockboxes outside the building and once inside it wasn’t any clearer as we had to go through a set of doors with no signs on where to go. Kitchen was not very practical as the oven looks like it’s seen better days, cupboards as well. Bathroom was miniature. No other mirror to see before going out and real lack of amenities",NEGATIVE
A clean and functional apartment in a nice and quiet neighborhood near the subway station. The only thing I didn't really like was that it is very white (except for the wooden floor) and lacks decoration which would make it feel less sterile and match the vibe of the city.,NEGATIVE
I was very dissatisfied and contacting the host showed how disinterested he was to help. I advise staying somewhere else if possible.,NEGATIVE
"I didn't enjoy my stay and cannot recommend it because: 1. Radiators in the apartment were constantly cold (not even slightly warm) and Host couldn't solve it. The temperature on the street was -3 and mostly windy and it was cold in the apartment especially at night The provided blanket was for summer period. There was no extra blanket sheet cover for the warmer blanket which I found in the closet to heat myself 2. Not possible to open the window to get the fresh air 3. Stains: on the kitchen chairs, on the door to bathroom 4. Lamp on the bed table didn't work 5. Feeling that you are chatting with bot - continues standard messages, where you need to repeat several times smth. Host asked to leave ""5 stars"" after I complained for radiators - he didn't ask if it become better, etc - so, it was just 'a typical' message I think Host should pay more attention to the apartment and to communication to the guests",NEGATIVE
"The water heater is not consistent, sometime it’s hot and sometime it’s cold. There isn’t any lift, it might be slightly difficult for people with huge luggages. The heat radiator isn’t hot even though we have max it. And it has loud noise for hours. But, the host is responsive in replying us and willing to get a maintenance guy to look at it.",NEGATIVE
A bit rough in the bathroom,NEGATIVE
"The place had a sewage smell when I arrived. It was recommended that I let the shower run for 15 minutes to get rid of the smell. The smell lingered for days, but it eventually subsided. All the other stuff Olaf took care of once it was reported like no battery in Apple remote and bath room light flickering. It just took time. It was sewage smell that caused me to lower rating. It was horrible.",NEGATIVE
"Small, cosy and quiet apartment ideal for 1-2 people though the bed was quite small for 2 people. Short walk to public transport and a 30 min walk into Old Town (Gamla Stan). Lots of restaurants and pubs in vibrant SOFO close by. Only disappointment was the lack of blackout shades / curtains which isn’t ideal for light sleepers like myself.",NEGATIVE
"Location, area, features of apartment all great. Sadly, I wouldn’t book again: 1 The apartment has 4 windows, 3 blinds,1 broken. None keep out light. Sunrise at 4:30 am, spelt the end of my sleep. 2 Improved communication requested from host: a)A few days before arriving I was told I needed to use an app for access. No mention in the listing. It’s to get in the building. The apartment is accessed by a key. Another thing to go wrong. I had to give my email and need both phone and key to get in. b) The host asked for my phone number twice. No reason. I didn’t provide it and felt uncomfortable. c) The place was cool on two days and there is no thermostat to warm. Host kindly said they would provide elec. radiator next day. They did not. We had organised access, no apology, no explanation. Arrived day after, 17 hours before checkout; too late/inconvenient for us. 3 Kitchen window opens to external balcony used by buildings smokers. 4 TV doesn’t work. Bring own powder for W/M and D/W???",NEGATIVE
"The appartement is quite simple and has potential. However, expect the bare minimum, the interior starts to be run down and especially the bedding is insufficient. Sadly the host was not helpful for something that can easily be fixed. What a missed opportunity. If you are hesitant between several options to stay in Stockholm I recommend you to choose another one.",NEGATIVE
"It was visible from the start that the apartment's reality differs from what was depicted in the pictures. The biggest drawback is the bathroom which is smaller than a public restroom stall. There are signs of wear and tear on the sink cabinet. It was virtually impossible to wash your face without bumping your head with the cabinet over the sink and your legs with the toilet and shower. The furniture doesn't have the best quality and there was only one window to be opened in the whole apartment. If you want to imagine the size of the kitchen, think: London Phone booth! We do appreciate the clean state in which we received the place but there could be some improvements which would leave the guests feeling taken care of. All these pictures, hostile&controlling rules and the price suggested a better service. It seemed as if we're staying in a luxurious detached house, though, the used up furniture and a kitchen sink tap which is holding on for dear life had nothing in common with that.",NEGATIVE
"In both bedrooms there was no curtain, in one of them the curtain holder was broken. The Kitchen is a 2 square meter hole with no windows. The toilet is so small that you cannot use the sink, the second bedroom only fits the bed. WFI is slow and sometimes does not work. The main electrical panel and the electrical distribution is home made and unsafe. The apartment does not reflect the description IT IS NOT spacious at all, and NOT fit for 6 people, 4 at max. The host was not available to share with us a mobile number to use IN CASE of EMERGENCY for the check in.",NEGATIVE
"WARNING!!! This is a super host, a guy claiming to be a person but it's actually a company behind it, not a real person. The host claimed unfounded alligations we were loud in the apartment and cancelled our booking at 9pm at night, leaving us no where to go. The host threatened to REMOVE us with their own security company if we don't leave. TERRIBLE SUPER HOST COMPLETELY GOING AGAINST AIRBNB POLICY STAY AWAY",NEGATIVE
"Can't say I'd recommend this place. First, certain elements of the stay were just not quite right. The bedrooms are tiny without anywhere to really put your clothes, and there was no trash can in the bathroom. But the real issue was we showed up and the kitchen sink was filthy. It then started draining nasty water that smelled. We informed Frederik and his plumber came to fix the problem. However, after they left the sink again started draining dirty water, and it eventually that spilled all over the floor and the counter. It made the entire appartment smell awful. A plumber finally did come and fix the issue after the second visit, but regardless it was pretty disgusting.",NEGATIVE
"Location was good, apartment was fine. Unfortunately, after 2 days we were consistently harassed by a resident. Our host did not take this seriously. lt began with an aggressive letter we found in the door and escalated to someone knocking on our door, ringing the door bell, talking to our door and trying to open our door to get in. This happened hours after we reported the letter, occurring at 4am and again at 5am. We could see through the peep hole someone was standing there and had to shout to leave us alone. Our host told us that “it was probably a resident who mistakingly thought it was their own door”. The next day, in the afternoon, the same person came back and done the same thing, the host again said they would consult with security, we had to ring multiple times before they had showed up for help. They then came back again trying to enter, also putting their hand in our letter box and grabbed my friend staying with us. We had to call the police ourselves. Very bad support.",NEGATIVE
"Surprisingly hard process to rent. After borrowing money from your card, you are hardly asked to provide your personal details and your social media accounts. The host will then judge and decide whether you are worthy of staying in their home. I think it is not far from the truth to call it humiliating. It was not clear whether you were chatting with the host or with a letting agency on his behalf. We were also told several times, on pain of a fine, to collect the bed linen and leave it near the entrance. At some point I forgot whether we were guests or cleaning staff. No problem - it helped us realise how dirty the mattresses and pillows were under the sheets and pillowcases. Apartments are nice, location is great, price more or less fair, host point of contact is freaky. Also host pushed us to provide 5 starts review",NEGATIVE
"I'd never recommend this place. You're not going to enjoy Stockholm here! They didn't clean the room, neither gave us a solution so we had to wash and dry the sheets. The quality of the bed and the furniture was very poor. They own the whole building and so you're a number, they don't care about you. Even that the customer care was lame.",NEGATIVE
"We strongly advise against booking this apartment! It was very cold when we arrived, we couldn't use the thermostat (not intuitive and no instructions included) and then it turned out that the air conditioning was broken. On the evening of last night the host finally brought us a heater (with a broken cable, actually quite dangerous ...). The communication was very poor, nobody took calls, ... Otherwise the ventilation system is very loud and sometimes came on in extreme mode in the middle of the night. The light in the bedroom was broken, the bed was very uncomfortable. But beautifully located in the middle of the old town.",NEGATIVE
"This is a beautiful, unique, and well equipped unit, in a phenomenal location. However, I would not recommend it based on the hosts communication, and the misinformation provided. The check in experience was clunky, rough, and late. The host takes for ever to respond to messages, if they do respond at all. And in the morning we were told at 9:15am our check out time was 10am when on the site/ posting and in the unit check out time is listed as 11am. When we asked for clarity we had no response. We sent both a picture of the rules in the unit and the posting they have on Air BNB. The host finally responded nearly an hour later at 10:10am, after we had scrambled to leave, that 11am was in fact correct. It made our morning rather unsettling, and started our day on a sour note. Aside from the issues with this host, you simply cannot be in a better part of Stockholm. It was beautiful, historic, and a brief walk to anything and everything you’d want to see. You are about a 20 minute walk to the train station but aside from that its a phenomenal location.",NEGATIVE
"Amazing place at perfect location! Very clean and just as in pictures! Bed was terrible though. And heating in the living room didn’t work so it was very cold at night, when we tried to turn the temperature up an error would pop up on the screen. Although I would go back but not for a long period of time as the bed was that bad.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is newly-furnished, clean and the location is the best in Stockholm. However the room temperature did not go above 21 degrees and even though I was informed about a regulator, it did not work. My messages were left unanswered. So it was a cold holiday for me.",NEGATIVE
"Mixed feeling, when I got in the appartment the bed slats were broken. Sent a message and all they can do is a discount in a burger restaurant. After this message no answers to my following request on Airbnb…. Still didn’t get any return from the owners !🙄 The Appartment was warm and clean, well located. One last bad thing, it’s saying that we’re supposed to check out at 11 (Airbnb and inside the appartment), but I realized I’m not the first who got a message on the morning I was supposed to check out asking me to be out at 10 am. So yep be careful guys !",NEGATIVE
"The apartment was great and comfortable, there was a dish washer, a lot of place in the kitchen and stuff for cooking. But! There was a very late check-in (4p.m.), and an early check-out (10 a.m). This is really uncomfortable.",NEGATIVE
"The appartment is nice and well located. However communication with the host is difficult. When we arrived it was 26 degrees in the appartment. In two days the temperatyre had risen in the bathroom up to 29 degrees. The host did not answer our questions about the heating system. Also there was supposed to be an ironing board but we didnt find one. As well as many others we got a message on the checkout day that the checkout is at 10 eventhough everywhere else it says 11. Host has not bothered to correct this eventhough many people have complained about it. Overall, nice appartment for a short stay but if you run into difficulties, it is difficult to solve them with the host.",NEGATIVE
"Very bad experience. Nice flat, very well located but ... no internet yet it was mentioned « internet » in the description. In 2022 it’s not a small detail. Despite several demands during my journey of 5 days, I never had internet. They didn’t answer when I asked several time for it and refused so far partial refunds. It’s the first time I write a negative feedback (and I have been renting on Airbnb several times a month for years) but the flat was not conform to the description and the communication was a disaster. As a conclusion, I would absolutely not recommend those hosts/ this flat.",NEGATIVE
"It’s right in the middle of GamlaStan, yet very quiet. The appartement is rather small and doesn’t offer any place to hang or store your belongings. We were a group of three adults and it was ok for a weekend trip. Unfortunately the heating didn’t work and it was very cold (16C inside, and it was snowing outside). At first we got answers really quickly, but they stopped replying at the weekends. Hence the reason for only three stars.",NEGATIVE
"My parents and I had a terrible and disappointing experience when we tried to check into the apartment. We waited outside the apartment door for over an hour trying to get in. Earlier that afternoon, the automated check in procedure failed, as we never received an automated email with our door code. When I reached out to the host via the chat to ask for the code, I did not receive a response. There was no phone number in the listing, and when I reached out to the AirBnB help desk they gave me a number for the host that did not work - the line simply sent an automated SMS saying that I should contact them via the chat. Thankfully, the AirBnB help desk (after several calls and tries) assisted us in entering the apartment. Five hours after I first requested the code the co-host Sofia finally replied saying that I should have received the code via email. I have never experienced such dismal communication and hospitality from a host/co-host before. We expected at least some level of communication and common courtesy, but alas we were shocked and disappointed. I cannot recommend staying at this apartment and supporting a business that is run at such an unacceptably low level.",NEGATIVE
"When we first arrived at the flat we loved the vibe of the apartment exterior, especially the location. However we instantly had trouble accessing the Airbnb. It is only accessible via a smart lock which was playing up. When I contacted the host to let her know that I have never used it and was having difficulty she did not respond. Finally after a few YouTube videos we managed to get it to work. The flat was lovely and clean. However we had troubles with the lock for the whole stay. It kept jamming and not working on instances. Finally on the last day at 9/10pm we came back to find that the lock was not opening at all. We were stuck outside with an unresponsive host. She was very unresponsive for the whole stay and communication was VERY difficult. At 1:15am we gave up and realised we our host is not going to help us. We had to book another hotel (radisson blu) and stay there without any of our stuff. No clothes etc. In the morning there was no message/call and no apology. AVOID",NEGATIVE
"Overall we were very contended with the appartement. Everything were very clean, snug and central . We only have one critism, Because it was very cold in December : the Temperature of the Living room . The heating system in this room doesn‘t work so the Room and the floor were cold. The temporary small heating system was not enough.",NEGATIVE
"A nice apartment in the very center of the city, but... it's unbelievable that there isn't a single closet or shelf in the apartment where you can store your wardrobe. it is not permissible to receive only one towel per person, which is used for hands, face and after bathing. the bed for the third person is extremely hard and uncomfortable.",NEGATIVE
"The reason for the lower rating is the front door was open (not only unlocked but actually ajar) upon us arriving, and when we told the host this they never replied to it or offered an explanation so that situation was very unsettling. The apartment itself was spotless when we arrived and in a great location. It did involve multiple flights of very narrow windy stairs so may not be accessible for everyone.",NEGATIVE
"The place all in all is good. The location is fantastic, however, it was not the best in terms of value for money/cleanliness. On the top of the bed there was dust. They gave one towel per person, we didn’t have any face towels, and we were staying for 5 nights. There is literally zero wardrobes or places where you can put your clothes. They left literally one pill for the dishwasher. The lights were not working in the bedroom. The guide is not updated, so many of the references and prices they send you are simply old. The internet was great, check in spotless, they answer fast (very general and with zero attention, yes/no/ok/no problem), but we felt like they did not pay enough attention on the customer experience & comfort, but rather just providing the basics. If you stay for a night or two is great, but for a week as we did, we would have appreciated more than just the basics, as we go to airbnbs for the comfort of being at home away from home.",NEGATIVE
"The accommodation is nicely located and in general it is a well-equipped apartment. Check-in is super easy. However, when we arrived the apartment had not yet been completely cleaned; a cleaning specialist was in the apartment for about 10 minutes while we were already there. Unfortunately, the apartment wasn't really clean either, especially on the kitchen table there were still sticky stains from previous users. But the kitchen itself and bathroom were clean. Unfortunately, all of the bed linen for the sofa was missing, but upon request, covers were quickly delivered, but no bed sheet for the sofa. Of course we could have contacted the landlord again, but since we only stayed one night, we didn't necessarily want to spend the whole time waiting in the apartment for the bedding.",NEGATIVE
"Great location in the heart of centre, clean apartment with all the amenities. The biggest drawback which for me was very painful was checkin after 16:00 and checkout at 11:00. So I think this is extremely inconvenient & inconsiderate.",NEGATIVE
"Pros: Good location, bright sunny flat, comfy bed. Cons: The cover picture doesn't match the flat. The nice furniture on these picture has been removed or replaced by cheaper versions. Some cleanliness issues (crumbs on the floor, smelly trash, hair in the shower, microwave, toilet, etc). Advertised 3 beds and had 1. I left after one night, spent hours finding a new place last minute and was ultimately refunded by AirBnB. The process was long and stressful, complicating the first days of a business trip.",NEGATIVE
The shower is very very small. i.e. the bath is nor really suitable for a stay longer than one night.,NEGATIVE
"The location of this place is great but it is a very impersonal apartment. There are only 3 chairs even if we booked in 4, some information we received is wrong, like the price of a taxi to the airport. The communication is not very friendly, writing in capitals on do's and dont's, no ho or thank you. No waste seperation.",NEGATIVE
"Host was ignoring all the messages. I needed to change my reservation due to changed flight and ended up paying for the service I never received, wouldn't recommend.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is very well located. Unfortunately one of the windows was broken and we could not close it. Due to that cold air and noise came in. The only solution Marianne offered was to open and close it again, but it was in a way broken you could neither open nor close it. I did not get another answer. Also there is no warm water, only cold one so taking a shower is not possible. I didn't get an answer to the question if I get a part of my money back due to this disadvantages. That's very sad.",NEGATIVE
"A very very basic place to stay. Very old and needs a lot of work. For a night it’s fine for 5 days it was not very comfortable, beds just ok, couch is stained and just the basics in the kitchen. The title of the property says Sodermalm but it’s in Glama Stan which you may liken but was very noisy.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is very nice and in accordance with the pictures. We were just disappointed as communication with Elias was quite complicated before and during the stay. Before our arrival, for verifying purposes, Elias requested to have all our email addresses and LinkedIn or Facebook profiles. We thought it was quite unusual to ask for such information. Also, during the stay, one of my friends got locked in one of the bathrooms. The door couldn't open anymore. We contacted Elias to explain our issue and we asked him to call us back. He didn't call us and handled everything per email so it took quite a long time to solve the issue.",NEGATIVE
"We had a mixed stay here. The apartment was clean but there were 3 chairs placed right inside the front door that we had to move in order enter the apartment on arrival. The check in information was not very clear - it took us a while to locate the lockbox with the key. The window blinds were partially missing or broken in all the rooms. But the main issue was the lock of the bathroom door got stuck and I was locked inside for over an hour. The host was not immediately available by phone or message so we had to call a locksmith to get me out. This was a very distressing situation and could have been very dangerous if there was a fire, or extremely inconvenient if we had a plane to catch. Since the issue had been mentioned in 2 previous reviews dating from the summer it should have been attended to before our stay. The apartment needs some maintenance to bring it back up to standard. Location is convenient with a bus stop outside the door. The beds were comfortable. The kitchen is dated but well equipped. There are some nice cafes within walking distance and an excellent high end supermarket (Cajsa Warg) for groceries. With a little love and care this apartment would be a real gem.",NEGATIVE
"One of the worst Airbnb experiences I have ever had. Decent location; spacious apartment. The host refused to send check-in information/instructions until I provided the LinkedIn accounts of myself and my two guests. This should have been the first red flag. Check in is at 3PM, and I arrived around 3:30PM, only to find the keys were not in the lockbox. The cleaner had to come downstairs to open the door and let me in. The beds were not made, dishwasher had just started, and the cleaner didn’t end up leaving until after 4:30PM. The Wi-Fi (barely) only connected in the kitchen area; it did not work in any of the other bedrooms or in the living room. It is also snowing in Stockholm this week (26F/-3C), and the host let me know that our building has central heating and did not provide any other options for additional warmth. One of the lights in the shower-bathroom did not work. There was leftover food from previous guests in the fridge.",NEGATIVE
"Really bad airbnb. Insanely uncomfortable- pillows were square couch pillows, beds uncomfortable, stuffy, ridiculously small grimey bathroom. Really really loud- broken elevator made extremely loud screeching noises that kept us up at night when people used it. Ground floor in back so if people outside, can hear them and smell the smoke from smoking if leave windows open. Host was totally not helpful- sent a note in advance that if we had issues we should fill out a google form instead of telling them (!!!). Lights went out first day and they had to replace something and rang doorbell when kids were still asleep (without prior warning) and were aggravated that we didn’t answer right away. No apology, unfriendly. Excessive odd rules- its like they thought they were doing us a favor instead of it being a paid stay! Felt totally unwelcome. Very expensive relative to other options at much much better price and location. Would not recommend",NEGATIVE
"On arrival we were disappointed that the third bedroom wasn’t made up and the exposed mattress was blood stained, this wasn’t a great first impression. We had to request linen for this bedroom which arrived the following day. I thankfully found a spare sheet in one of the cleaners cupboards. The third bedroom opens onto the kitchen and its plastic sliding door was broken and didn’t close properly offering little privacy. Looking at previous reviews, this isn’t a new issue. The shower room and separate toilet are windowless and both have broken or very inefficient extractor fans. The flats Venetian window blinds are difficult to use and reach and the master bedroom was missing one curtain. The flat is in a good central area which is convenient for bus and metro and close to local restaurants and supermarket. The flat however does require a spruce up to mirror the standard depicted in the ads photos.",NEGATIVE
"We’re seasoned AirBnB guests and this was our first disaster. Initial communication was ok but they collected a lot of info, including social media accounts for all guests. Entry locks were phone app controlled and we spent an hour troubleshooting with the host just to get inside. Turns out they had mixed up reservations and keys. We were then provided wthe key to our booked apartment where there were already guests! The host 'Elias' and the co-host Guestit felt very remote and there was no human support on site. Phone support was hard to understand at times. After two nights in the wrong unit, we had been locked out two more times, and spent many hours communicating about swapping to the right unit. When we finally got to the right apartment, it was still not cleaned, did not match up with the listing pictures, and we found massive, hand-shaped blood stains on the bed mattress. We left for a hotel that night. Thankfully, AirBnB provided refund and compensation. Stay away!",NEGATIVE
"Very low quality bath towels and blankets. No soap and shampoo in the bathroom. Very small bedroom, hall and bathroom. Place is not worthy for what they charge. The only plus is the location.",NEGATIVE
"Location is central and neighborhood is quiet. Host was responsive and instructions were clear for check in and out. Shower head wasn’t working well, water pressure weak. My stay was short so it would have been a hassle to have anything done by the host during my trip. Would have liked that this was checked beforehand otherwise the stay was nice.",NEGATIVE
The place is on the 4th floor without a lift. This has not been mentioned in the write up. This created a hardship for us and we feel it should be included in the write up. Otherwise we were happy.,NEGATIVE
"We recently stayed at Daniela's place, which looked adorable in the photos. However, we found that it might be more suited for someone seeking a minimalistic retreat. The space was quite small, and the amenities were simpler than we anticipated, which left us a bit underwhelmed. Unfortunately, the bed quality and the towels provided didn't meet our expectations, which was disappointing. We reached out to Daniela right away to let her know that we couldn't stay and requested a partial refund, understanding that she could likely rebook the space. Daniela was very responsive and friendly, doing her best to accommodate us, but ultimately, she decided not to issue a refund. That was a bit of a letdown for us. We sincerely hope she managed to rebook the place! It might have been helpful to have a clearer description of the five flights of stairs and the key pickup location, as it would have helped us make a more informed decision before our stay.",NEGATIVE
"I enjoyed my stay in the penthouse, which was very nicely situated and offered ample space for one person. It was not as great as I’d hoped, however. Daniella was very communicative but at times there was almost too much detail in her messages. I also felt somewhat pressured by her messages to check in late and check out early. When I arrived I was disappointed that the smoke and cm alarm was laying on top of the fridge without batteries. The most disappointing thing was the bathroom, which has a strong sewer smell which was not resolved during my stay despite a handyman stopping in. The hot water also completely ran out quite early in the shower yesterday. I hope this feedback can help her and the company to make improvements for future guests.",NEGATIVE
It could be made a bit clearer that the sofabed and the double bed are in the same room. Not ideal for friends or colleagues sharing.,NEGATIVE
The room was good but I didn't like the toilets at all...,NEGATIVE
"This is a lovely apartment in a convenient location in the Stockholm shopping district. The apartment is spacious, and the kitchen well-equipped. As others have mentioned, there is ongoing construction on the entire building, meaning that there is scaffolding and plastic surrounding the building. This had two unfortunate effects - one is that we were not able to access the terrace that is featured in the description, and the other is that there was very limited air flow through the apartment. It was quite warm while we were there, so this was very noticeable. We only found out about the construction when we arrived, so this was quite a disappointment. Otherwise, we were glad to be able to stay in a convenient location, and very grateful for the availability of the laundry (in the basement). Robert met us at the apartment and showed us around, which was helpful because the laundry and garbage locations are a bit difficult to locate in the basement.",NEGATIVE
Absolutely terrible place. The space is much smaller than it appears in the photos. Kitchen is not well equipped at all. The beds were extremely uncomfortable. The shower floods the whole bathroom. There is no backyard despite the listing stating that there is one. We booked the place for a month and left after a week because it was unlivable.,NEGATIVE
"Corporate hotel complex, do not except to stay in a Airbnb, do not except cooking facilities. Just a place to sleep in a good area . No flexibility, even check time at 4 pm is questionable, just good communication . Garbage place is questionable too, always too full. Cleaning staff does not what is a customer nor they care",NEGATIVE
"I can't stay in this host's apartment, he asked me to leave as soon as I entered the apartment asking for cancellation and I was not answered. I feel like the worst human being of all species, I'm trying to get my refund and I have no news yet. So be very careful because they are very prejudiced if you are a guest who is going alone. I never had any problems on Airbnb and I have great recommendations about me. Hosts have to remove the apartment from the application since it is not open to all audiences. He asked me for proof of work and asked me a bunch of questions. It felt like I was a criminal.",NEGATIVE
"There r 2 hosts, both super friendly and responsive 5* but the apartment felt very shabby and it wasn't entirely clear to me from the listing that the wall dividers were like Ikea showroom dividers vs proper walls. Also the fridge door was broken (they were responsive about and fixed a few days later) so we couldn't get breakfast/snack foods-an appeal of an Airbnb over hotel. In the scheme of things these things were minor although I don't feel the place was accurately represented (pictures oversold it), the 2 things that bothered me most are : 1. it's by a Hilton conference center and our unit faced the courtyard for the meeting space where people smoke and gather on breaks to talk loudly; in fact people even lean against the windows. The smoke comes through the cracks of the windows (BTW, despite the cracks, windows can't open, so at night we couldn't get fresh air) & 2. our unit's door code wasn't changed on arrival so the 1st night someone came into our room- kind of unnerving",NEGATIVE
"Advertised as bedrooms. Per Swedish laws, in order to be considered a bedroom, it needs windows, openable for ventilation and escape routes. (Boverkets byggregler 6:253, 6:322) Due to lack of this, they can only be considered “sleeping areas”. There are no walls between the two areas. There are no proper escape routes as required by law as windows can not be opened. Only one thru door. Also no visible fire extinguishers. Window shades do not block out street light during night. Extremely busy foot traffic outside and noise is terrible. Beds have the low standards of cots. I have never slept less than this during a vacation. The “sofa bed” in main area is really terrible for either sleeping or sitting. We were three people in there and I’m glad we like each other because privacy is non existent.",NEGATIVE
Overall this was a pretty good stay with a couple small nits to raise! - As folks have mentioned there is no elevator in the building so suitcases are harder to navigate (though just one flight) what was more annoying was navigating to the building entrance from the metro station which was incredibly hilly and filled with stairs - the Queen bed is actually two twin beds pulled together with a foam topper on top. Don’t be surprised if you wake up with a gaping hole in the bed - there are some stains on the mattresses that have accumulated over time Other than that. The location is perfect and spacious and accessible to the rest of Stockholm!,NEGATIVE
"We booked this apt because of the family friendly description but we were surprised by several things. The walls are very thin and we had noise complaint regarding my 6 year old being too loud as soon as we arrived--this made us very uncomfortable to be in the apt. He may have had a moment and we calmed him down within minutes but it was described as 2 days of noise. Also, you have to be very careful with the floors being uneven--I stubbed my toe twice and also almost tripped on my way to the bathroom at night-- in the USA, this would cause massive legal issues if anyone got hurt. Another thing was the kitchen with no nearby plugs-- when we made coffee, it barely reached the outlet on top of the stove--made it difficult to make a simple breakfast. Also, their toaster is very cheap and smelled like plastic fumes when you tried to use it. Also, no small cereal bowls-- the easiest thing to feed kids is cereal and milk. Location was great and host was responsive but it was just ok",NEGATIVE
"The host is absolutely terrible. The apt looks much nicer in the listing’s pictures than in real life. The pictures seem to be modified, and some of them have nothing to do with the apartment. The host instead of utilizing Airbnb features for check-in instructions sends links and verbose messages, which are very annoying. It wasn’t mentioned in the listing’s house rules that guests are required to take out their own garbage, some of which has to be taken to another building for recycling. Apparently, cleaners can't do that. It seems the host needs six hours to clean this tiny apartment. I asked for an early check-in. Sure, no obligation on her side. She sent me several messages repeating herself (sounding like a bot), then gave unclear suggestions, such as wasting my time by going to the apartment to contact some staff (where?) and, if they say no, going somewhere else. She couldn't call them and ask when the apartment would be ready. She also denied my request for a late check-out.",NEGATIVE
"I could not stay at the place because it was under renovation, which I found out when I arrived at the place at 11pm at night. The host did not reply until the morning after, I therefore had to book an expensive hotel to not sleep on the floor of a construction site. Terrible experience.",NEGATIVE
"Nice flat, well located, very central, view not very inspiring. Good value for money. Some critical points, though: cupboards and closets have no handles. As you have to open them by putting your hands on the surfaces, these were not clean. We asked for cleaning, which was partially done. Nicol and Hedvig were very friendly and reactive, however they could not solve our second problem during our stay (over New Year): a very smelly bathroom. The smell probably comes from the gutter. We consider the flat should not be rented again before this is solved. They very kindly granted a discount for a night because of these problems.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is in a centrally located and minutes from Gamla Stan or the ""Old Town"". It's also close to the Slussen metro stop. There's major ongoing construction work in the area, but it doesn't seem to have much negative impact for guests staying at this property. Check-in time is after 16hr but yet check-out time is at 10hr, which seems a bit unfair. The access code, I was advised, would be cut off at 10hr. Most check-outs at other places I've stayed at are normally at 11hr or 12hr. It ended up working out just fine for me based on my arrival/departure schedule; but I can see how this could be an issue for other guests who might need more time, especially for such an early check-out time.",NEGATIVE
"Overall nice place to stay. Good location, reasonably clean and well equipped. Strangely there are no doors on the bedrooms which is not great for privacy or noise. Also the light and vent above the stove did not work.",NEGATIVE
"This apartment is located in a really convenient location to both the touristic area and transportation. In general a well maintained unit. The unit´s layout is awkward if privacy is needed, as there are no doors in either one of the sleeping areas. For us it was not a mayor issue. The wifi access is really spotty as it is only available in a tiny portion of the apartment. Don’t know if this is a constant issue or a recent problem. Obviously the relevance of stable wifi connection is only relevant depending on each guest´s needs. In our case it was.",NEGATIVE
"The location of the apartment was very good and central. There were no doors inside the accommodation except the one to the bathroom. The smaller bed was right next to the door to the bathroom and next to the kitchen. The furnishings were complete and sufficient. Except for the ""coffee machine"" which is a simple filter machine that did not work properly and was extremely dirty. It was a shame that the apartment was not really clean when we checked in. The bathroom was very dirty, there were stains and hair on the wall, sink, shower and ceiling from previous guests. Likewise, the beds had not been properly cleaned. On the ceiling of one bed, there were obviously blood stains and a lot of hair. The comforter cover was probably freshly made, but the real blanket and pillows were not. Which was clearly seen, as these not only smelled unpleasant, but showed lots of hair, stains and glue residue. All in all, the accommodation was ok.",NEGATIVE
"A great location in Stockholm. Clean apartment, proactive and very informative host. Some things to be aware of: none of the rooms have doors so almost no privacy (mentioned in the pictures descriptions but I saw it after booking). Bathroom has issues: door makes a lot of noises when opening / closing it, potentially waking up those who sleep near it. Bathroom tiles while so beautiful are cracked and potentially injury inducing.",NEGATIVE
"Overall the apartment was nice. Our major issue that should be pointed out was the door to the building was faulty. We were locked out multiple times, once late at night, as the keypad stopped working. The hosts did not answer until much later, and the solution offered to reset the keypad did not work.",NEGATIVE
"Positives: Communication from the host was always quick. Super clean. Easy to find and close to the centre. Negatives: If you arrive early or are leaving Stockholm late, the place where you can leave your luggage isn’t 100% safe. We were told that we could get a luggage locker for free at the Central Station, this isn’t true. You’re charged a cleaning fee, which is the norm but expected to get rid of your own trash, poor form. The basics, ie tea/coffee etc are dregs from other guests, again this is poor form and isn’t the norm, at least not in my experience which with Airbnb is extensive. The flat needs some TLC. Ok, so this is being really picky but in this day and age it’s insane that a rental doesn’t have a smart TV or at least a TV where you can link your devise to. After a lot of sightseeing and an evening of fun it would have been nice to just sit back and relax ( there’s only 1 proper comfortable chair, though the flat is for 2) alas all there was is a old TV.",NEGATIVE
"The airbnb is very conveniently located near pubs, restaurants and public transport however, the studio is not very convenient for cooking. also ventilation is a problem in the studio, when windows are open there is lack of privacy. also the shampoo and body gel was almost empty when we checked in and had buy our own.",NEGATIVE
"Very centrally located — moments walk from Slussen metro — and quiet despite being at the busiest part of Södermalm. However, it is very small, the only windows face into an internal courtyard, and the kitchen/dining area is tiny with no oven. Ideal if you just need a place to sleep and shower, but it’s not the kind of place to lounge around in or leisurely cook dinner. The host (company, not individual) also spammed automated messages and told me to refer to the PDF when I asked a simple question.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is a nice size for a studio and has everything you'd need for a short city stay. The downside is that that the only windows open onto the internal courtyard, and noise from that courtyard is amplified. There is a continuous low level noise of some sort (like a large extractor fan), which I found annoying (but others have not commented on this so perhaps it is just me!). I think this would be fine in colder months, but not ideal if you want to have the windows open during warmer weather. Slussen is an easy transport hub, but with the current construction works is not the nicest part of town to stay in. Nicol did warn me about this, and I'm sure does the same for other travellers!",NEGATIVE
"Its a nice place to stay because is walking minutes from all the attractions. However, there was 3 of us and extra bed was actually a sofa that was really uncomfortable once when you open it and we couldnt sleep there. So I wouldnt reccomend this place for 3 people.",NEGATIVE
Very noisy from the loud construction outside and noise from the large hotel across from across the entrance way.,NEGATIVE
"Lovely clean apartment in a good location, with a polite and responsive host. The beds unfortunately were terrible. The fold out chair bed I can understand but not having a proper mattress on the double bed is unforgivable (it was instead a 5cm thick foam pad, like on the chair bed).",NEGATIVE
"The apartment had already been booked, but hadn't been taken off the listing. So I needed somewhere desperately as this was on the day and immediate booking was available and confirmed only to be told the place was already rented.",NEGATIVE
"Annas place was a bit strange, there was lots of clutter, no lights and the main lamp that was to provide light didn’t work. There was no bin bags. Air bnb is not actually aloud in this building.",NEGATIVE
Host never provided check in information. Number was disconnected. Didn't respond to Airbnb message. Needed to contact Airbnb to cancel.,NEGATIVE
DO NOT BOOK Host never replied,NEGATIVE
The biggest cons were the bed is not comfortable and shifts during the night and you have to keep readjusting the mattress every couple hours. We tried to use the laundry room but it was broken and our host just said she would look into it and never heard back. The laundry room was a huge reason we booked this place.,NEGATIVE
"NOT up to Airbnb standards. Upon arrival the fridge was packed full of the hosts food and other personal items including a nuva ring meaning we had no space to store our own food & drink, the bins hadn’t been taken out and it hadn’t been thoroughly cleaned. In the bathroom there wasn’t a full roll of toilet paper for 3 people on a 4 day trip. When we went to put our clothes away every single drawer, cupboard and wardrobe were bolted shut, including bed side tables, meaning we had to live out of our cases on the floor of the living room, which meant we couldn’t make full use of the main communal space. When we contacted the host about this he suggested we use the shelves under the TV which were tiny and full. He was unhelpful and when we listed the issues to him, he called us ‘boring’. It felt like the host spent more time locking things away than making the place hospitable to paying guests. Sir, you aren’t doing me favor, you’re offering a service and you didn’t deliver!",NEGATIVE
"Unfortunately, the apartment was not clean when I arrived, to the point of being unsanitary, and it took 48h to get a partial cleaning. The bed had clearly been slept in, there was a lot of hair in the shower and the toilet was extremely soiled. There were crumbs and stains on surfaces and on the ground and bits of food in the sink to name a few. It is a shame because the apartment is otherwise lovely, quiet and conveniently situated. The host was somewhat accommodating of a late arrival. It could certainly be a homely place to stay if it had been cleaned, like some travelers apparently experienced in the past. Unfortunately it was quite unpleasant for me.",NEGATIVE
When we arrived at the apartment we were able to unlock the door but neither lock from inside nor outside. We contacted the host explaining that the lock wasn't working and we needed someone to come solve the issue. We stood helpless for over 30 minutes without a response trying to problem solve through a manual for the automatic lock though google. Eventually we left after no help and a door not working. Sad experience,NEGATIVE
"the place way more cramped than photos show. wifi was inconsistent. water was leaking from 3 skylights including above bed. we slept in only dry spot, the sofa. we also mopped up water with bathtowels. elias said he'd provide us with fresh ones, this didnt happen. also no temporary 'fix it' was offered. heating cut out regularly. lighting poor in kitchen. towel hooks useless. lots of little things I'd never normally mention but overall the experience was poor and no solutions were offered.",NEGATIVE
"Whilst the apartment itself was as the pictures shows. The terrace - which was the main reason we booked this airbnb - was not available to use and we were only told this the day before we were due to arrive which is misadverting. On a smaller note, there were no curtains which was an issue given the sun rises at 4am in Stockholm this time of year",NEGATIVE
"I wish I would’ve stayed somewhere else. I think in the winter or fall this Airbnb wouldn’t be as much of an inconvenience but the fact that the unit is on the 8th floor attic of an apartment complex with no air conditioning meant getting a good nights sleep even with the fans provided is not very feasible. When we arrived the counter tops were dusty and there were dirty dishes in the sink. We let the host know this and instead of apologizing all he said was that he would let the cleaning crew know, definitely not the best response. The host also was not very communicative at all during the stay, we asked where the toilet paper was and let him know that we found it later on and never heard back, it would’ve been nice to have some sort of communication. Finally, the patio that is advertised in the pictures is completely false advertising, in reality it is a empty unusable space allegedly due to water damage but the host didn’t let that know until after we booked - completely unethical",NEGATIVE
"Andreas‘ place had a great location: many restaurants, stores and close to the metro. The furnishement in the apartememt itself was also really nice. Unfortunately, the place was quite dirty. Everything was covered in dust and we didn‘t really want to use the kitchen because most of the utensils hadn’t been properly cleaned.",NEGATIVE
"BEWARE: I ended up paying $99/day more than the listed price. It was listed for $239/day ( I confirmed this by rechecking the listing price on a weekend, we stayed 9 days) I was charged 337.97/day plus taxes and $473.54 Airbnb fees and a cleaning fee. The owner of the apartment said that they did not change the cost of the room per day but I ended up paying almost a $100 more per day. I sent them I screen shot of the cost per day and they did not offer to rectify the situation but blamed it on AirBnb, This came out to $437.89/day with everything included for a reasonably located but small poorly lit studio apartment with a bedroom. I felt like this was a BAIT AND SWITCH situationI should have paid more attention and I will in the future.",NEGATIVE
"This is a very basic apartment located in a great area. Suitable for one college age person who is very easy going. I am not that person. It seemed like ZERO thought went into making this feel like 'home'. Felt like a cheap hostel with an excessive amount of rules. I hated it. There is a light fixture hanging so low that every time you pass you hit your head. There are no couch pillows so you can't get comfy and read a book. You're limited to one bath towel and one hand towel. There's a wooden 'bathmat'. Plastic kettle. One pot, 2 pans. No leftover anything in the fridge. No dish drying mat, one old sponge. Limited kitchen towels. Nowhere to put your luggage. IKEA linens were scratchy and old. Pillows need to be washed. Nothing about this space was comfortable. Everything about it felt cheap. It's obviously a business and not somebody's home.",NEGATIVE
"This apartment was immaculate and had all the amenities you could need. From washer and dryer, to a coffee machine, full kitchen and just a comfortable overall stay. Just be prepared that taxi's are not permitted to drop you off at this address. We weren't aware of this nor were told prior to arriving. I had a infant, stroller, car seat, lots of luggage. I had to carry it all two blocks to get to the front door and the streets were coble stone that made things even harder. Other than that, the location is beautiful and we enjoyed our stay.",NEGATIVE
Very beautiful apartment! My only complaint is that the 2nd bedroom has no air circulation whatsoever. This is quite unhealthy and for our stay in the summer it was very hot and difficult to sleep.,NEGATIVE
"First off, I know this is a motel for young travelers and it’s a “digital” motel, but the check in and communication was just awful. We arrived early. I had asked in advance if it’s possible to store our luggage before the room was ready. I was told, that’s no problem. We arrived at 7:30 am. The door has a keypad. It says to check the email you received to open the door. I have not received an email. Checked spam, trash etc. I messaged on air BnB. And the sign by the door also said that the reception is open 9-11am and “digital” reception is open from 8am. Ok. We decided to get breakfast and come back after 8am when we can get a hold of someone. We came back at 8:45. I messaged the number on the paper via what’s app. I also called. No response. It was now 8:55. Ok, at 9am the reception opens, so hopefully we can get it. It’s 9 and we ring the doorbell. No reply. Some guy was standing outside near us the whole time. Tried to talk to us. A bit creepy. Still no reply. It’s past 9 now. Finally someone comes outside and we can get inside. We walk down the super tiny steep steps. The guy, who was waiting outside walks in with us and proceeds to sit on the couch in the “lobby”. I guess random people just hang out there to use the free wifi??? Super sketchy. Anyways. No one at the reception desk even though it was past 9. Finally someone replies to me on what’s app and gives us the room code, house door code and code for the luggage room. I was so hesitant to leave our luggage as there’s a lot of people just hanging out and who knows how often they change these codes. Just no supervision at all. But we were so over it and just wanted to start our day. The room was ok enough. We had a private double bed room. Bathrooms were fine except I was kinda uncomfortable considering a hangout area is right in front of the showers room and there were a lot of men (30-40+) hanging out. There’s a microwave and fridge and all went well in the end. But didn’t really feel safe and the fact that there just wasn’t anyone accessible was not ok. I guess its ok for some, but I definitely won’t be coming back.",NEGATIVE
When we arrive the room was so dirty. Everywhere stains on the bed… Moreover the trash of the previous user was still in the room. The bed was not ready. And that was only the room. We didn‘t checked the bathroom and kitchen… The lamp was not installed and the unisolated cable just hang from the roof.,NEGATIVE
"Rooms are not being cleaned in a well manner between different costumers. That 60sek fee is meaningless, lines are dusty . The kitchen was almost impossible to use due to the presence of food everywhere",NEGATIVE
You shouldn’t use Cyrillic letters at your name. Got some problems because of that.,NEGATIVE
"So I assumed this was someone’s house but it was actually a room in a hotel/apartment style place. He was very responsive when I first booked and then the day before didn’t respond to my questions which made me nervous it was a scam. It was smaller than I thought as it was not a home but it was very clean and they had washing/drying amenities. Also it was Monday I was staying there and there were a bunch of drunk men at the bar that then went out to smoke out the back and woke me up shouting at 11pm. Location lovely, more residential real side of Stockholm with great coffee shops and a fantastic restaurant called Bar Libertine.",NEGATIVE
this is the place you should rent not those overpriced apartment in Södermalm.,NEGATIVE
"Obs: Obs: Obs: - GDPR data breach! To use the same tone and format - if you care about your data, I would not use this accommodation. My name and details were left out in the open at the reception (employees work there only from 6:00 to 21:00 daily) on the day of checkout, together with other people checking out that day. Definitely not OK. We checked out at 4 a.m. and could see everyone else checking out that day. Also, comfort is a subjective term: I would not describe this accommodation as comfortable. The building is 15 min walk from the station (reasonable), but there is a nice steep hill you will need to drag your luggage on to get to the building. The bed is big enough for 2 people, but it's a pain to get in and out for one of the two, because of how the bed is placed. The bathroom is very dark and poorly lit. The door to the bathroom needed some oil on the hinges, it would wake up the other when using it at night. The water basin for WC flushing is on the same wall where you rest your head in the bed - it was not nice at all to hear the noise made by it. The dishwasher did not work (error code we couldn't reset) so had to wash dishes by hand daily (not the worst but also not the best to do on vacation). Two out of four lights did not work in the room. We also got the room closest to the exit so it was nice and noisy with people slamming doors and hanging out at the chair and table outside the entrance. Again - if you can deal with the above then you might find this accommodation ok. We sure didn't and felt we paid a lot of money for a very poor quality accommodation. Would not recommend it.",NEGATIVE
"So i arrived earlier, at 04:00 bc i was told i will be able to Check in at that time. Planed Everything assuming it would be possible. Suprise i wasn‘t. I called the hotline asked why i can’t Check in and the person was rather rude, acting like it was my foult that i was told something wrong. So i had to wait till 10:00, haven‘t slept for almost two days and exausted from the flight. Later i called again bc i was told by this person that someone will be at the reception. Again wrong. Nobody was here. So i had a discussion with this person, this time he was nicer, i guess the lack of sleep took a toll on his mood. Another suprise turns out he was able to Check me in all along. I guess he just didn’t want to? Just had to Pay a fee for the earlier Check in, which is fine. So i would‘ve given one Star for this, but the room was alright and the Location is good. But the Communication definately has to improve and i won‘t be Coming back. Thanks",NEGATIVE
"Terrible host! You can't touch and talk in a human way! On the morning of our trip, our son was in an accident! A bike broke down! Broken arm and bleeding head. We took her to the hospital and wrote to the host at 10:40 in the morning! I wrote down what happened. I asked you to understand! Was not willing! He did not return the reservation! Whoever paid for the apartment did not accept my brother and my wife! So I canceled the reservation! He refused to cancel the reservation and I spoke on time. He said he couldn't take them! I didn't get back half of the money I transferred. I would not recommend it to anyone. There is no compassion in it!!!!! Go to a hotel rather than go!! Not a good person!!",NEGATIVE
"Quite disappointed. While the location was decent and as described, the apartment was much smaller than it seems on the pictures. There were stains on the blankets and the extra pillows. The fridge smelled really bad every time you opened it and there was mold in the shower and moisture up the wall above the bed. Also, you can definitely hear the neighbors REALLY well, so not really a place to work from/quiet hours… Just feels very cold and due for some maintenance.",NEGATIVE
"I had to wait in 0 degrees with rain falling during check in, while Andreas never responded to my messages, had to call Airbnb and wait for an hour. There are so many things I can complain about this place, though two examples to give are, the bathroom stinks and secondly keys are kept 200 meters away from the apartment in a bike lock. He also has instructions in check out that say “if you forgot something, I won’t be able to return” how inconsiderate.",NEGATIVE
"Unfortunately, my Airbnb stay turned out to be a disappointment. Despite a small yet clean room and a well-described listing, the bathroom emitted a persistent burnt smell. The host's suggested solutions proved ineffective, and their lack of action forced me to endure a discomforting night with open windows in freezing temperatures. Despite notifying the host, there was no responsibility taken, and I had to leave immediately due to health concerns. I cannot recommend this place based on my experience.",NEGATIVE
Profiling. My personal informations as LinkedIn and other social medias were asked after the reservation. Reservation canceled the day I arrived in Stockholm as the previous tenant apparently lost the keys of the studio. I had to book an emergency housing in the hurry. Very stressful experience. Lamentable.,NEGATIVE
"Lina was a great host and was kind enough to let us check in early. She responded to all our questions very quickly and was very accommodating. The big downside to this place was that because it was located in a basement of sort, it was very stuffy and there were a lot of insects and spiders there which made it feel dirtier than it probably was. There were several BIG spiders inside. I will say that Lina helped us get rid of them, but it still made us a bit uncomfortable. The room also felt very stuffy and almost 'moist'.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is very small, dirty and smells of sewerage coming from the toilets. The furnitures are in a very bad state. I couldn't spend the night there and had to leave after an hour. I got charged one night plus the cleaning fees even if it was dirty. I would not recommend.",NEGATIVE
"Good location, nice smart TV. Bathroom had some amount of mold and calcium stains. The quality of bed is very low.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is nice and like in the description, small for 4 people but acceptable for that price. The location suited us perfectly, and the bus stop right next to the apartment makes it easy to reach the centre. Kitchen appliances a bit disappointing (limited pots, knives, missing plate for 4th person) especially that the possibility of cooking is often what makes people choose AirBnb over hotels. The bathroom was not the cleanest (with some mold) and the sofabed quite uncomfortable unfortunately. After all it’s good for the money, but with little effort can be even better",NEGATIVE
"Small and nice apartment with everything you need! It's perfect for 1-2 people max. The sound insulation isn't the best, you can hear the neighbours open the doors and walk on the ground floor (the apartment is on the 2nd floor with an elevator) and I could hear the neighbour showering at 7am, it woke me up. If that was mentioned in the description or comments I wouldn't choose this apartment. The sound insulation from the outside is also not great but it's a super quiet and nice neighborhood that is close to the center by public transport (that's why I chose this place), therefore it wasn't a problem at all (noise from the outside). The host was very responsive, understanding and nice. If you aren't a light sleeper or don't mind using ear plugs, I would definitely recommend this place!",NEGATIVE
"Missed spending valuable time with my disabled cousin, who we were visiting in Sweden, since unable to access Lena’s place until after 4 PM when she completed a video webinar there that she was leading. She’d already delayed our check in time from 2:30 to 3:15. The nearby restaurant she recommended for us to wait and a cafe nearby did not have WiFi … At least she allowed us to drop off our bags while we waited. Also unclear what to do with the trash as we were not familiar with the trash chutes used in Sweden. Finally we did not get instructions about what to do with the apartment keys until after the usual 11 AM check out time.",NEGATIVE
"Quiet location, clean apartment, comfortable bed although pillows need replacing. Couldn’t use TV as remote was lost and although host offered to sort it, it was a little in our stay. If you’ve been walking most of the day, the four floors of stairs are not ideal. We found the lift very small and claustrophobic so didn’t use it.",NEGATIVE
"Excellent location, quiet, beautiful views, clean, very feel-equipped kitchen though miniscule. A couple of issues though: the bed is very soft and uncomfortable, the blinds and curtains do not keep sunlight out and sun comes up at 3:30am. Darkening shades would be more appropriate. In addition, I do not appreciate receiving a text from the ""co-host"" after we've checked out pressuring us to give her and the apartment a 5 star rating. I have been using Airbnb for years and this is the first time this has occurred. Very unprofessional. To be fair to the co-host, she might be required to do this by the company she works. They seem to manage many many apartments in Stockholm.",NEGATIVE
"Good location, 4 mins walk to the metro to get to the Old town, decent kitchen if you enjoy cooking. Unfortunately, while the photos match the description of the apartment, for a couple, it was much smaller than expected. We spent 2 weeks there but it wasn't too comfortable. There isn't much place to sit and relax, there's the bed (which is more like a super single) and the chaise lounge. The biggest hassle was that there weren't any curtains at all in the room and we ended up waking up at 4:45 - 5am due to the lack of them. This is Erica's home so while it is comfortable for her, it definitely isn't for most guests so if you do happen to stay here, carry sleep masks. If you are working from home, the internet somehow worked best where the dining area is, it dropped a few times for us in the room and not sure why, since the room is just next to the dining area. Recommended for 3 - 4 days at the max.",NEGATIVE
Sofa bed is too uncomfortable and too small for 2 children. Bar music noise only allows you to fall asleep at 00:00. Location its 100% cool ... Apartment flooring is deteriorated in some parts .,NEGATIVE
"It is a good apartment but not worth what we paid for it. The bathroom layout was very poor (you need to squeeze between the shower and basin to reach the loo. The tile grout and sealant in the shower was mouldy. Also the second bed was a sofa bed which when folded out blocks the main door. The main apartment space is really nice though but the overall impression is not as good as the photos as the chair upholstery is now very damaged. The location wasn’t really for us as we preferred less touristy areas where the food etc was much cheaper. However, noise was not a problem for us and the beds very comfortable.",NEGATIVE
"I was charged for cleaning when the place itself was not clean before we arrived. We left the place cleaner than we were given. The bin in the bathroom was completely full with rubbish when we arrived. The sheets were dirty, stained and had multiple stray hairs. Charging a crazy amount. I had thought that they would be brand new as I would of happily of paid for them, but they were not. They charging people to clean and new customers after me the same for it “to be cleaned”. This is ridiculous you are taking money from new customers for things that should be mandatory in any Airbnb. The cooker is slow, it would shut off randomly causing us to eat out. The customer service was also appalling, they gave the option for the sheets and the cleaning a few hours before we arrived. We also weren’t shown much respect after we asked for a toaster. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Ridiculous charging for basic needs. With this money you are better off going to a 5 star hotel.",NEGATIVE
"Apartment was fine, the host is not a real person but though. Stock photo and automated messages are a bit impersonal. Annoying to be asked for additional identification when this is the case.",NEGATIVE
"Very bare bones, bed is extremely uncomfortable (almost unsleepable) and host canceled early check in (which we paid for) the day before leaving us stranded for 6 hours with a 2 year old child. Was not willing to accommodate even a minute earlier then 3pm check in.",NEGATIVE
The place was small and dark not like the images from the photos. One thing to expect is the very steep and narrow round stairs up to 4th floor that could cause problems to the senior and the week leg people.,NEGATIVE
"Ok for one staying, but overpriced for this appart. Dusty flat, furniture looks old, lamp on band, somewhere missing peaces of paint, very dark. Noisy I could hear everyday people communications behind the walls, when you open window the small is not good and noise of ventilation. Around the placement some constructions are going on. The most bothering thing is that host was texting me all the time during all days, few times per day, asking to not use other towels for no reason. Always asking things like to be nice, but it is very bothering. Second day of my staying they wanted a man to come to change the lamp, when I’m not there (door anyone can open with a code) so I wasn’t happy about it. I didn’t rent a flat to see a random man next to my bed, so I needed to care whole day my docs and money with my in case someone would come. But finely he didn’t. I don’t understand why repeating couldn’t be done before my arriving. So for this price better yo take a hotel.",NEGATIVE
"Wonderfull place, Very clean and decent. All you need at the perfect location. I only have my concerns about the checkin proces. After booking using airbnb you have to send a copy of your ID and a selfie to the company. I don’t feel comfortable sharing that information.",NEGATIVE
good place only tv is not working,NEGATIVE
"The location of the apartment is phenomenal, however due to its closeness to the street you hear a lot of noise and besides this, the clean service of the city starts at 545 am and the bedroom is literally right next to the place where they pick up the garbage so you hear everything and they are you up very early. It is a noisy street so you would be hearing noises until 1 or 2 am. On the other hand, there is not enough hot water for 4 people staying in the apartment.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment was spacious and clean and the location for access to Gamla Stan is great. Not so good aspects: - the music from the restaurant directly underneath - tourist noise from the windows facing the main thoroughfare in Gamla Stan - we had a lot of trouble getting the front door to lock when we left the apartment. ..and we didn't notice any fire alarms or sprinklers in our apartment / the building - not great, particularly with a restaurant directly beneath.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is in a great location, but to get there you have to walk through a dark basement if you don’t know how to turn on the hallway light. We felt the apartment was not as nice as the pictures and the noise on the weekend was really loud.",NEGATIVE
"Extremely noisy, not just from outside but the other above apartments. Dirty shower cubicle which flooded the whole bathroom floor after each shower. Spiral stairs to Level -1 were unsafe to walk on and carry luggage. The positive: great location, spacious living area, clean and comfortable beds",NEGATIVE
"There was a severe problem of mould in the bathroom during my stay - so much so that I could not bear the smell and did my teeth in the kitchen sink, avoiding the bathroom at all costs! Communication was not particularly helpful, although they sent a very kind cleaner who tried to (unsuccessfully) to get rid of the overpowering smell. They then, without informing me, sent other site staff to the apartment to look. I don’t appreciate others entering the apartment without previous permission/agreement, and they responded that the smell was trash outside… which wasn’t the case. They also left the bathroom door open, allowing the pungeant smell to permeate the whole apartment. Unfortunately there are no windows that you can open and so no ventilation whatsoever in the apartment. I wouldn’t stay again for that reason. However, if they were to fix the mould problem and get some ventilation, it is a spacious apartment and has some thoughtful amenities and comfy bed.",NEGATIVE
"Great location, however this listing doesn’t mention that the ceilings are so low if you are 6 ft you will be hitting your head multiple times a day. My girlfriend who is 5’6 was also hitting her head. The first thing we noticed was that the apartment wasn’t properly cleaned, the silverware/pans/glasses were absolutely filthy and had to spend half an hour cleaning them upon arrival. There was also random items like someone’s chapstick on the counter, candy, and a dirty toilet. While showering you will be required to crouch as the roof arch is part of the bathroom. This is not a typical “Stockholm shower” The location is great and it has potential but would not stay again with that level of cleaning.",NEGATIVE
"This apartment was very nice, and comfortable. It is in the attic and so a lot of stairs, not accessible if you needed. there is a lift but only up until the 4th floor. The apartment is a short walk to the underground and is in a good location. It was disappointing that the oven did not work and not could be sorted during our stay, so we wasted food and this made it difficult due to me being gluten free. The host was there to reply to messages, however i didn’t feel like they were very helpful and when asked for gluten free recommendations, simply said they couldn’t help.. other hosts have been excellent with this query. I would recommend this place if you’re on a budget, it’s good for the price.",NEGATIVE
"Cute place near old city center. If you are tall, the bathroom will be a challenge. The room has no curtains, so when the sun is up, so are you. In a place the sun almost doesn't set, that's a little bit annoying.",NEGATIVE
"Unfortunately, the worst Airbnb experience I've ever had. The host (Amelie) was manipulative, passive-aggressive, and unhelpful unless she got her way. 3 days before arrival, she requested I pay more money than what was already agreed upon and paid for. I respectfully declined and was okay finding another place to stay, but she just continued to be extremely difficult to communicate with unless I gave her more money (which I did not). She delayed check in, held the keys hostage unless I agreed to additional rules not outlined in the booking, like confirming I lie to her neighbors on her behalf, and… demanded I check out earlier than what as agreed upon in the booking. I wish I could share screenshots of the messages she sent me. I would absolutely never stay here again.",NEGATIVE
"It was a good location and decent price. However the mattress on the bed was very bad quality which resulted in me getting back pain from sleeping on it, the bathroom did not have a nice smell, there were not many utensils such as plates and cups in the kitchen so we had to buy paper plates for our stay. The best thing about the place was the location.",NEGATIVE
"text with your camera You will come across a very old house with very old furniture. There is always an inappropriate and strange smell in the whole house, which bothered my children. The kitchen equipment did not meet our expectations at all. All old and very used. Suggestions for the future: Using new kitchen utensils Use of fragrances Using scented detergents for bedding In the end, we thank Martina for her efforts.",NEGATIVE
Location was great and the host was very communicative and prompt to solve any issue. Unfortunately we found the apartment to be not very clean and a bit basic. Also pretty noisy. Second floor walk up,NEGATIVE
"There were stains on the furniture from the previous tenant and the bathroom had a sewer gas leak that we tried to mask with coffee beans, we had to keep the windows open to keep the smell under control.",NEGATIVE
"Five days stay, somewhat disappointing. William watched impassively as I dragged my heavy suitcase up the two steep spiral staircases, not offering help. Parts of kitchen utensils found dirty in dishwasher. Poor kitchen equipment (no oil, salt, cereal bowls ...) Living room is mainly empty space. Ambience of a waiting room. Toilet legroom partly occupied by washing machine. Overall, sparse and uncharitable in the details. Info folder says to contact immediately when unhappy, but communication was agitated and insensitive. No apology about the kitchen utensils. Instead, the offer to move out (felt almost like being kicked out). Somewhat invasive email on the last day, remembering to leave latest at 10, decorated with a chummy suggestion to give them a 5 star rating, they would do the same in reverse. Good: Excellent location. Quiet at night, from 11 pm to 7 am. Top coffee maker and stock of beans, second towel was delivered at short notice. Bed perfect. Spacious closet. Fast internet.",NEGATIVE
"This place is situated in a bustling neighborhood in Gamla stan. The interior and kitchen are nice and functional with lovely common areas. One bedroom is very small and the other is large. The clothes washer is great to have. There is no tv. Because of the building’s age, the windows don’t seem to open. Two big negatives: the bathroom has an extremely noticeable sewer gas problem (likely due to the lack of a p-trap for the sink), and the digital locks (that require an app) for the building and the door are a hassle—much slower and more cumbersome than simple pin pads or digital keys.",NEGATIVE
"Nice neighbourhood but surrounding streets were very noisy at night. Rather cramped room, no storage space for clothes.",NEGATIVE
"Well-located for local amenities and access to transport to the city as well as being within walking distance to the old town and city centre. The flat itself is small, cosy and very light. However, the bedroom is VERY small - the double bed is snug against the wall on three sides. If the person on the inside wants to get in or out of bed they have to climb over the person on the outside! Added to this it gets very hot in the bedroom - there are no windows nor air movement - so it doesn't make for a comfortable sleep. The sofa in the living room is not conducive to sleep on either so not an option for one person to use the bedroom and the other the sofa.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment was very clean and tidy on arrival with a simple design focused interior which reflects the listing images. What soon became apparent however is that this is not a dedicated holiday apartment and is in fact someone's home. This meant that the cupboards were packed with their belongings and clothing with not much space to store our own. It very much felt like we were staying at a friend's or family's apartment and we didn't feel completely at home or relaxed in. Given this was not alluded to on the listing we felt a little cheated. The apartment is run my management agency who were of little help when it came to addressing our concerns. In the end we had to raise an airbnb dispute to resolve. Aside from this there were a few areas which could be improved on: the bed, as others have suggested is painfully soft and to add to the discomfort we were only provided with single duvets, one being soiled. The bathroom is basic and there is nowhere to hang towels, the sink is awkwar",NEGATIVE
Nice surroundings and cozy place but the place was messy,NEGATIVE
The small house indeed stylish and well-equipped. The neighborhood is calm and nice. However the online house rules only mentioned that we have to take out the trash and wash the dishes. But at the place the printed house rules stated that the cleaning is not included at all and we are expected to clean the house in a way that no additional cleaning needed before the next guest check-in. We were disappointed.,NEGATIVE
"Quite expensive for a basic, small and budget amenities. There’s mold in bathroom and toilet needs refreshing and coffee and other items were old and dried out. It’s next to a parking lot so people can view your bedroom and you hear people quite easily as well as the neighbours walking on the ceiling. The blackout blinds are not great and hair dryer has a special plug which I couldn’t figure out where to plug in to. I didn’t appreciate the security camera in the hallway. I understand for “security” but I don’t feel OK by being able to be overhead and recorded 24/7. However, the host is very easy to talk to and extremely responsive so if you are willing to pay for good location then this is ok.",NEGATIVE
"The flat is very nice. I would have liked more kitchen utilities because I love to cook. What is disturbing is that the cleaning fee is very high, 60€ and you are expected to do much more then other Airbnb houses when you check out. You need to take out all the sheets from the beds and collect the towels and put them by the door. You need to do the dishes and place the dish back. Go out with the trash. I dont mind doing this things but not when I need to do all this and then pay 60€ in cleaning fee. It does not feel fair.",NEGATIVE
"Good location and very clean apartment. Only downside is that it is not really furnished with much, it's a very plain apartment. This might not be a factor for some people but something as simple as not having pillows on the couch or the lack of decor can make staying there for a long time a bit of a downer. There were also some Wi-Fi issues that I had to message the host about. The router can't be seen from within the apartment, so for people looking to stay there and work remotely, just know there might be spotty connection from anywhere within the apartment and not great speeds. The last issue we had was the hallway lights; they would automatically turn on due to some movement sensors, and were not controllable with a switch or dimmer. This meant that if you got up in the middle of the night to use the restroom, you'd be met with super bright lights that turn on the moment you step out of your room. Some small inconveniences really, but added up can make you notice them. Other than those issues it's a very spacious apartment, was extremely clean when we arrived, had very nice bathrooms and showers, and was truly in a great location within Gamla Stan. I'd recommend this place for large groups or families that are doing short stays, but maybe not for people who are choosing to work remotely.",NEGATIVE
The apartment’s central heating was not working. We were freezing the entire time and ended up getting sick. The host was not eager to fix the problem and we ended up involving AirBnB and moving from the apartment ahead of time. The apartment is stripped of anything personal - no pictures on the walls etc. Clearly just used for Airbnb renting out.,NEGATIVE
"Great location, very spacious apartment. Easy to check in and out. Main complaint is that the towels were quite stiff and rough (even taking into account air drying instead of using a dryer). Also, some of the sheets did not seem to be fully cleaned.",NEGATIVE
"Location location location. This apartment is in the middle of Gamla Stan so a perfect location. The apartment itself was incredibly bare bones and rather uncomfortable. The building was under construction so there was lots of noise and dust. The pillows were terrible, the laundry room smelled of sewage, and the hall light was motion detected only so we couldn’t turn it off at night. It would eventually go off but if anyone had to grab water or use the bathroom the lights would blare full force again and then we had to wait a long time for them to turn off again. The Wi-Fi was also spotty and the towels were like sandpaper. The walls were completely bare and the owners seemed to do the bare minimum requirements with no attempt to provide a homey feel. Check in was very late (4pm) and check out was early (10am) and they wouldn’t allow luggage to be stashed upon arrival. Despite the lackluster apartment, Stockholm was wonderful and we had a wonderful visit in this beautiful city.",NEGATIVE
"Unfortunately the stay at the apartment was not a pleasant one for me. The location was great, the size was great, it was clean but the whole apartment smellt very strongly of flowery laundry detergent. The smell was so overwhelming it ruined my stay. I had brought my own sheets and towels since i know i am very sensitive to perfumes. But the curtains were all washed in the strong smelling detergent and there was no escaping the smell. The rest of the guests whom are not sensitive to smells like myself were also bothered by the strong odor. Great place otherwise but if you have issues with perfumes or strong floral smells i do not recommend staying here.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is in a great location, and was very easy to find and check in with a keyless entry system. Once you are in the apartment however there was not much good to say. The first thing noticed upon entry to the apartment was the overwhelming smell of sewage coming from both bathrooms, which quickly overwhelmed communal spaces. The apartment is very sparse with little in the way of furniture or decoration. One small pillow is allocated to each guest and to be honest they are the worst pillows I have ever used in any hotel or apartment around the world. The towels are also not of a particularly high quality. The bedroom I used had no light fitting but instead a tangle of wires hanging from the ceiling. The rest of the apartment is fitted with LED strips hacked into the walls and motion sensors that become especially annoying with bedroom doors that don't close properly. Overall the whole experience felt very impersonal and purely driven by profit, with every expense spared.",NEGATIVE
"Best things first: the host was very responsive and the aprtment is well located and close to the subway station, lots of redtaurants and bars. However, it is very noisy. Even with closed windows you can hear the people in the streets and noises from restaurants/bars. Sleeping with open windows is impossible. This is particularly bad, as the air in the apartment is not good at all. It gets very warm and sticky and smelly. This might be why there is also an airventilation system, which, however, is constantly running and loud. The beds are not really comfetable and the pillows are really a joke. They are super small maybe 30x30 cm or 40x40 cm, thin and clumpy. The apartment is also not well equipped. Two of the three bedrooms have hangers and a clothes rail. However nothing else to store anything. One bedroom has nothing. A lock of a bedroom was broken, so the door did not shut. Eventhough promised, no handyman showed up to fix it. Very dirty. Toenails next to the couch.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is easy to find and in a great location. Unfortunately we were given the wrong door code and we had to wait without a response from the host for about 30 minutes. The apartment was clean but spartan and we had to buy toilet paper our second day. The hallway lights inside the apartment are motion sensor and there’s apparently no way to turn them off or down, which was quite annoying at night. The apartment is at the top of 75 stairs in a beautiful old building, and has been recently renovated. The beds were slightly uncomfortable and there is one thin pillow per person.",NEGATIVE
"The host asked us for too much sensitive information to let us book the apartment which was very annoying and trespassing. Generally, he had too many instructions including cleaning the dishes before leave (we paid cleaning costs though). He also didn’t provide us with any recommendation to our one and only question (about where we can do canoeing). In conclusion, the apartment had fair price and good location but we didn’t feel welcomed.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment was ok, but it was samller than expected and the location was not that great.",NEGATIVE
"Host didn’t mentioned that there are 15 steps to the entrance door. We had a big luggage so it would help if host notify prior booking. Also, the rug in the living room was dirty so we ended up vacuum the floor when we checked in. Host was asking too many requests for check out such as trash, take out bedsheets, etc.",NEGATIVE
"Overall, not so great. 1. We were supposed to check-in at 13 but she changed the time to 14 the evening before. We were going to a concert (the reason why we were in Stockholm) and this was upsetting since we had planned to go there in time to minimise the queuing time and unfortunately it wasn’t possible (we got to know this only because we texted her the day before). 2. When we arrived at the flat the door lock was stiff and it took us quite a long time and energy. Only after calling her to understand which manoeuvre was needed, we could open the door. 3. On top of that, the apartment was too warm and the heating could not be turned off (about 28°C for the floor T and the heater in the bathroom was even warmer). You can understand that when it is already warm outside having the flat at an even higher temperature makes sleeping a very difficult task even with the window open. The check out in the morning was at 12 but at 10 two people making out in front of our door tried multiple times to enter the room (we do not know who they were but they searched for the house keys under the doormat). We will not book this place in the future for sure.",NEGATIVE
no elevator for a 3rd floor apartment with suitcase is difficult+ no place to store luggage,NEGATIVE
"As a host myself in the states I was extremely disappointed and disgusted with levels of unprofessional behavior. Let me first start with host never stating that cars can not drive in that area know as “Old Town” after a certain time of the night. I arrived very late due to flight delays, took a taxi that cost 750 SEK, and had to walk 6 min to the building. Upon entering the building I walked up 3 flights of stairs to sit in front of the door for an 1.5 hours. You see I never received Nuki code for the door. And after messaging, texting, and calling along with Airbnb calling no one ever answered. I ultimately had to leave get an Uber for 1,012 SEK to take me back to the airport. It was now 2AM. I booked a hotel at the Airport to sleep for only 3 hours because I had a very early flight. This was the worst experience EVER. I’ve never did a guest like this as host also.",NEGATIVE
"The location is good. But if you have a lot of luggage and as old as me, then it may not be suitable as it is in old town with cobble stones and hard to push the luggage. Also, the unit is on 3rd floor with winding stairs and difficult to carry heavy luggage up... The host did not provide kettle for boiling water also. Some airbnb will provide coffee and tea but this host did not provide any coffee or Tea... The heater was not as hot also and it was very cold at night during our stays. But it is near metro and inside the old town, so it is convenient for food.",NEGATIVE
"Amazing location, great apartment, BUT...they need to do something about the motion detector light inside the entrance to the apartment. if you get up to use the bathroom that blinding light goes off and stays on for 5 min before shutting off. There is no way to turn it off manually. I always get up early to run on vacation and that light going off as I'm leaving is unacceptable to my sleeping guest. It floods the room. Only other complaint are the teeny tiny, flat pillows. Other than that, great apartment smack dab in the center of Old Town. Loved our stay. Does get a little loud at night and in the morning as other tenants are returning or leaving. I use ear plugs so it wasn't too big an issue.",NEGATIVE
"The automatic lighting is quite annoying as if it gets triggered by mistake, it stays turned on for minutes and it cannot be turned off. There was no waste bin in the bathroom, and it is really needed. There was no foot towel either. The host provides very clear instructions but they are quite long paragraphs and it is a bit tough to find what you need without reading lots of information about things you don't need at all. We were also requested to take out the garbage and take it to a whole another place, it is really disturbing to have this requirement when you are trying to leave the place in a hurry. For positive sides, I would say the location is amazing, the apartment is in good condition and is big.",NEGATIVE
"The location is good, but I do feel that the issues with communication made it an overall unpleasant experience. I received slow and literally single letter responses that did not answer my questions. Additionally, they sent a handyman at 10:00pm on a Sunday with no warning at all. I get things may need maintenance but a little courtesy heads up would have gone a long way.",NEGATIVE
"Very clean apartment and easy check in but it is a very basic, minimal airbnb. There were not enough towels making it difficult to clean up after meals or dry your hands after going the washroom. The linens were terrible - they felt like singe use hospital sheets. The beds were also not very comfortable. It was also a bit difficult to reach the main sights of Stockholm as this apartment is a bit tucked away.",NEGATIVE
"you get what you pay for, here. Tiny place, bad shower (everything in there gets soaking wet when you shower), uncomfortable beds. It's an inexpensive place to crash but you won't want to (or be able to) do much more at this spot. It was very difficult to find parking so we ended up spending $75 on garage parking over 3 days.",NEGATIVE
"The good: 1. Floors are very clean! 2. The location is walkable to restaurants, buses, shops, and family-friendly. 3. Big park and playgrounds nearby. The bad: 1. The sheets, towels, and pillows are the absolute lowest quality. Pillows are extremely lumpy. So uncomfortable. Not ""great quality"" like the listing says. 2. No sheets for pull-out couch (expected adults to sleep on bunk beds rather than the pull out couch). 3. Others have mentioned the small bathroom with shower that sprays all over, which did not bother me, but there's no bath mat or other protection so you can walk around safely. One person in our group slipped and fell. 4. Photos make the apt look much larger than it is. It's fine -- not sure why the owner has to use inaccurate photos. Just tell the truth. 5. Location is not accurate on map, it's about 1/2 mile (650m) east -- location is fine, again, but don't use an inaccurate location, just tell the truth.",NEGATIVE
Would stay again. Only downside is the lack of exhaust or a window in the bathroom.,NEGATIVE
"Booked the location for 4 nights but Airbnb moved us after the first day. The location did not match photos, furniture missing and/or changed, lights and TV with no place to plug them in, shower handle broken. Airbnb agreed with our concerns and we moved to a hotel. Very inconvenient in a new city.",NEGATIVE
"Great location. Trouble getting in.Lock have a “catch” no one mentioned before. Shades in the living room broken, ugly looking, not fixed even after promise it will be before our arrival. So sleeping in the living room not too pleasant due to late sunsets and early sunrises. Huge amount of dust on the wardrobe in the sleeping room. Extra force needed to push the nob for warm water in the shower. So not the best stay ever…",NEGATIVE
"This apartment needs work. The blinds in the living room are fully broken and inoperable; you cannot get any darkness in there, which is challenging when it is light out nearly 24 hours a day. The doors are also challenging to lock and unlock as there seems to be some issue with the seal between the door and the frame. We could not find an iron, which was a disappointment, and after inquiring about it, the response we received was ""check in the wardrobe"" and then, ""it should really be in there somewhere."" We also had trouble operating the shower, which it should be noted is rather narrow. There were no house instructions as to how to operate the things inside the home. Johan was accommodating to our desire to check out late which we appreciated, and the location is fantastic.",NEGATIVE
"+ Good location, easy access, really clean appartmant, all kitchen and bathroom supplies provided. -Blinds in the living room were broken so it was difficult to darken the room/appartmant (have a child that sleeps during early evening). The lock on the second door to the appartmant was bit tricky to handle. It was really loud and you need to put in exact position to lock appartmant. Heard that our neibghours in the appartmant next to us had trouble with that too.",NEGATIVE
Wellplaced appartement of good size. Reasonably equipped. Good babyset. Bit of an odd smell upon arrival. Felt the separate children’s room was not so practical for our one year old son as there were lots of power cords. TV remote volume control not working well.,NEGATIVE
"The place is located in a really nice, central and good area so for sure it has been really easy to go around the city but the picture we thought are not really matching the space. The space it was smelly and the bathroom was quite dirty, mold was a bit everywhere and the bedroom is extremely small. Linen and bathroom towels I don’t want even talk about it, but definitely super bad quality stuff. The host has been super communicative but the experience has not been what we expected; price wise worthy but if we knew it we could have chosen something different. Always really sorry to experience these kind of days :(",NEGATIVE
The broadband did not work for some hours. The fridge did not work. No useable electricity points in the kitchen. Photos were of a completely different flat. The bedroom and lounge were one room. The breakfast provided consisted only of items that could not be kept in a fridge . But then the hosts liaison person was polite and helpful.,NEGATIVE
Was absolutely freezing all night,NEGATIVE
Everything was good it’s just unfortunate that on the first day we arrive smth went wrong with the hot water and we couldn’t shower until the next day.,NEGATIVE
The initial meeting with Camilla went well. She showed me the room and the apartment and seemed very friendly. First night was very quiet and had a great sleep. Then it all completely changed and her behaviour became very aggressive. She spent the second evening constantly banging doors(including mine) and walking around the apartment until well past midnight. The next morning I found a very aggressive note on my door and she accused me of damaging her flooring by wearing my shoes and having no respect for the property. Even though I had hardly been there and had removed my shoes when I had. Very strange behaviour and not the first time looking back at other reviews. I left the property and had to arrange other accommodation for the evening.,NEGATIVE
"The WORST airbnb treatment ever. Got my money full refund! That says it all The house is not the problem, the host is. She is downright condescending, disrespectful, and treats you like shit. No one, and I mean no one, deserves to be treated like I was treated by her. There was a misunderstanding because her ad said “there would be co-living spaces and kitchen,” so I thought I could use the main kitchen. I called her to ask how to use an induction, and she yelled at me for using, and I apologized to her multiple times and cleaned up after my stuff. (Honestly, if she had given me a proper house tour before, or explained something to me, this “misunderstanding” wouldn’t even have happened). Very long story, but in short, for two days, despite my constant apologies and my explanation to her, that I did not know, and will not use the kitchen again, she referred to me as “you make me nervous,” “why are you excusing yourself?” “Why are you making this an argument?” (When I have been const",NEGATIVE
"too many people in the flat, felt crowded, kitchen, toilet and bath occupied to much..",NEGATIVE
"Location is accessible via metro and in a quiet neighbourhood. The room and the facilities was adequate. However, the shared bathroom and personal guests of the host can be a little unsettling. The bedroom locks were not functional and the kitchen was untidy in places.",NEGATIVE
"This could be a great place to stay but the host hasn't invested in the property at all. The bedding, towels, toiletries etc. are the cheapest possible. Some of the absolute basics are missing, such as WiFi and iron/ironing board - there weren't even coathangers in the wardrobe and shampoo/shower gel provided were really cheap. I also think it's unacceptable to charge a cleaning fee and then also ask guests to strip the beds and empty the trash (especially with the threat of a fine) That said, the apartment is in a great location, is very pretty and was in a clean condition when we arrived.",NEGATIVE
"Unfortunately very disappointed with this stay. The apartment had the bare minimum. No coffee maker (everyone in Sweden drinks coffee), toaster or even any spices, nothing but the basics (forks, plates). For an apartment in an expensive area you would think they would have WiFi! Also very loud, we were woken up many times before 8am. Location is in a nice area but honestly expected more for the price we paid.",NEGATIVE
"The listing was approximately 3 blocks from Eriksplan station which was 4 stops from T centrale and 5 stops from Gamla Stan (the historic district). Had shops, grocery stores and restaurants on the opposite side of the block where the listing lied. Some people may not like the shower as it had no separation from the rest of the bathroom and water would spill to the rest of the bathroom. Would recommend it to anyone else going to Stockholm who wants to be comfortable, close to the city but at the same time in a quiet neighborhood and looking for a relatively affordable location.",NEGATIVE
"Not what I expect from an Airbnb booking. Extra steps outside Airbnb needed to book, standardised messages, if there is something wrong you have this weird webpage.. The apartment is just ok. Elevator was not working on arrival so we had to carry all suitcases up (think somebody left it open on another floor), the drain from the shower was cluttered, there were only 3 coffee cups for 6 people apartment, 4 chairs, and generally poorly equipped. Something that was offered in one of the standard messages that we could let know, but I don’t want to spend time on this during my stay and should be apparent. The 2 bedrooms and the living room/bedroom/kitchen are all on the street side. We were lucky to have super nice weather in Stockholm, but also means that you want to have your windows open during the night, but there was quite some noise on the streets. All-in-all not worth it in my opinion.",NEGATIVE
"There is a bar on the ground floor and there is a lot of noise on Friday and Saturday until late at night. Unfortunately, the person who manages it, Olof, was a nightmare. Until 18:00 I could not enter the apartment because the cleaning was not ready. On Saturday evening we watched the Champion League final at home and we talked a little louder. The next evening he told us to vacate the apartment, although we still had 3 days to pay. At that moment the nightmare began. I talked with him and the Airbnb representative to clarify the situation, but Olof made it his ambition to kick us out. We managed to stay in the apartment until the end of the stay because we read the AirBNB rules and they can't let us out until AirBNB notifies you 24 hours in advance.",NEGATIVE
Excellent location. Shower drain was not working. Water was flooding. Some other broken items. Nobody came to fix those even we complained straight away.,NEGATIVE
"Nice apt . Maybe over priced. I had an allergy to something in the space. Something to do with the old building i think. Overall the handling of the communication was good as long as I was going through the business funnel meat grinder , but when I had specific request that could not be fulfilled it was not handled gracefully and the remote worker they have managing the communications has definitely been instructed to stick to script which makes it lack the wholesomeness of many other more personal Airbnb experiences.",NEGATIVE
"The place itself is beautiful and located in a great area. But we had some issues with the hosting. 1. There are security cameras and motion detectors inside the apartment, which was not stated in the listing. When asking the host if we could cover them for our privacy we were firmly told that this was not something they would allow for “security reasons”. 2. Someone with keys entered the apartment at two separate occasions without our consent. 3. There were no available closet space, so we had to keep our things is suitcases for our 3 week stay. 4. There was an apple tag attached to the keys, which may seem like a good idea to be able to track the keys, but when it ends up tracking you as a guest it’s an intrusion of privacy. While there are definitely positive things to say about this place I would not recommend it based on our overall experience.",NEGATIVE
"We had a few issues with our stay - we hadn’t realized how impactful the shared living would be. The way to the bathroom and shower was long and went by where the host was sleeping and cooking. We wanted to use the kitchen one morning in the time we were told would be okay and the then the hostess’ daughter said that its a bad time because she’s sleeping right by the kitchen. Lastly, the dirtiness caused by the cat and coliving made it an unpleasant experience for us, especially in the bathroom. Aside from all that, the room is nice and in a great location.",NEGATIVE
"Quite nice and spacious apartment with nice view. The public transport is really just a small walk, though to home all the way up. Unfortunately the bathroom really needs some renovation, after showering everything is wet. The kitchen lacks some utensils. Though, we asked Andreas also replied but we couldn't get them during our one week stay, but cooking and eating was manageable with the utensils they have there just a bit uncomfortable. The flat is indeed quite cold, though at easter time it was snowing in Stockholm. Getting in the apertment was without problem. Some neighbours do not really respect quite hours, but that is not the host fault.",NEGATIVE
"The pictures definitely oversell the apartment and it's definitely not as chic as it looks, there's a reason why there are no pictures of the beds. The beds are super uncomfortable and feel like you're sleeping on bare springs. There are barely any kitchen items to use and no basic amenities in the bathroom either. The one bathroom you can shower in has dreadful drainage, forcing us to use towels to help contain the flooding. There's a very elaborate list of checkout tasks which, considering the heft cleaning fee charged, feels like a crime. The host was also not super responsive. I forgot an expensive pair of sunglasses in the apartment which I communicated to him within a few hours of checking out but he was unable to help me retrieve them. To be fair the view from the balcony is exquisite, but in no way makes up for what the apartment is lacking.",NEGATIVE
"The place is in a great location. Walkable to everything you need and close to subway. Apartment has good bones but otherwise the place is falling apart. The front right cook plate is always at a 12. Be careful. The oven latch gets as hot as the oven. This is a safety issue with children. Only a few pans were usable. The others are so scratched or handles not attached fully. The pillows are just cotton balls in a pillowcase. Needs replacing. If you plan to watch TV, bring your own chromecast or apple tv as these tvs are not smart. The view from the apartment is lovely. The place is somewhat ok if you just stay a night or two and don’t plan to cook or do anything but sleep there. But if that’s your type of trip, stay somewhere closer to the attractions.",NEGATIVE
"Beautiful and huge apartment with amazing views, ideally located on Kungsholmen. My main issue was that it is clear this is more of a money making machine, with people checking in and out all the time and issues not being resolved (the shower is a mess and leaks everywhere as per several reviews). It is clearly managed by a company and the cleaners had failed to unload the dishwasher and had left two dirty boxers behind! The whole process felt a bit impersonal.",NEGATIVE
"The place is at a great location, lots to do! but it wasnt great at other things! The beds weren't comfortable, the pillows weren't either! Also the keys to the laundry room wasnt anywhere to be found! The lockbox was empty. About an hour late for check in! A bit disappointing since we paid so much for the place.",NEGATIVE
"The description is quick to mislead travelers. It says one bedroom but the ""room"" is not at all separated from the living room. There is no door, nor any possibility to isolate it from the living space. We were surprised on arrival. The communication with the host before arrival was unpleasant, since despite a reservation made several months in advance for the new year's eve, our host waited 3 days before the trip to communicate to us extremely strict rules about noise, implicating we could get thrown out of the place without any prior warning if anything went to happen. On the good side, the host was very reactive when we had a problem (wifi not working at the beginning of the stay, he immediately had someone to come), and the apartment was comfortable despite the inconvenience mentioned at the beginning.",NEGATIVE
"Great location, Great appartement. Unfortunately was not cleaned at all.",NEGATIVE
"A great emplacement, the appartement is nice and clean, good quality/price ratio. Easy communication with Patrick. But the lack of good curtain is a problem for the sun in bedroom and there is no curtain in the bathroom. The one place bed is not very comfortable and the blanket is too light.",NEGATIVE
"Really great location, nice apartment. Disappointed to be paying £300 a night for no blinds in the bathroom, especially being opposite a playground. Needs rectifying immediately.",NEGATIVE
"Very poor experience. The flat is cold and the host couldn’t be bothered to provide the requested extra blanket. The bedding is very poor quality, 2 single duvets which are very thin, definitely not for winter. The pillows are horrible. The windows are very old and you can effectively feel the cold coming in and the bed is next to the window. The bed cover had stains on it. The 2 towels that were provided - one of them a beach towel, the other one with hair on it. We had to look for other towels in the cabinet, all of them of horrible quality, some had tears also and lots of stains. No toilet paper left in the bathroom. Leftovers in the fridge. Not even basics like sugar or tea left. No instructions inside the house on where to find what. The host will told us he is out of town so he can’t provide extrq blankets and then stopped responding. Could have asked us to buy one in store and refund us the value, but he didn’t care we feel cold. Would not recommend staying here.",NEGATIVE
"The place is okay for staying for one or two people for at most two weeks. Staying longer or having more people cramped into that space won't be a good experience. Overall, the place feels cluttered and in need of some basic maintenance and organization. Most of the cupboards are almost full of something, leaving little space to put own belongings. In the kitchen, there is enough dishes to serve a multi-course meal to 8 people, yet there are only 2 big spoons which is not enough for one person. The ironing board and the iron must be older than me and the ironing board is covered in stains.",NEGATIVE
"Very high maintenance cost compared with other objects. Cold and when staying short time you do not have the time to make sure the appartment heats up, even if there where more radiators to use. Bed ok but blanket very thin which did not help when so cold (around 15 degrees Celsius at arrival and I managed to get it up to 7 degrees when I left after 2 days).",NEGATIVE
The apartment was in a very good location. The bed was too small 180 cm in length. And the most problematic was that the lift didn’t work during my stay so created a difficult situation.,NEGATIVE
"David doesn't seem to care much about his guests. He'll tell you he'll try to come & fix something the next day, then you don't hear back for the rest of your week-long stay. Besides, the internet works about half of the time, the shower door is broken, cleaning is dubious, mattresses are razor thin, I could keep going on. And don't expect any of the basic necessities (TP, shampoo, trash bags, etc), you'll have to go buy everything yourself, and wait for shops to open the next day if you arrive late. Great location, and competitive price, but that's about it.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is situated in a quiet alley in Gamla Stan. The spiral stairs to the 3rd floor, where the apartment is located, are narrow and with small steps, which makes it difficult to climb with a plane cabin size suitcase. Not recommended for small children and people with difficulty in walking. Cleaning definitely needs some extra effort. The place is warm and with hot water 24hours. On the day of our arrival, David called us for extra tips and information. But later on, when we needed to contact him for an important question about the apartment, communication was not easy.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment was situated in the old town, very central location. There was clear and quick communication with David. However, upon entering the apartment, up three flights of narrow winding metal stairs, we soon discovered the apartment was not as expected. The bathroom was dirty, had a broken shower door, empty leftover bathroom products and in need of a deep clean. The kitchen had leftover out of date food left in the fridge, which was also filthy. General maintenance in the kitchen was poor. In one corner of the room, lots of belongings such as towels, bedding, ladder had been left piled up. One of the beds had a broken leg and poor quality of bedding/towels.The window on the landing had been smashed and was taped up with newspaper. The electric wiring in the living room light had been left exposed and not attached to the ceiling. We had to leave the apartment, obtain a refund and secure alternative accommodation due to the lack of cleanliness and safety issues in the apartment.",NEGATIVE
"Only stayed at the apartment for a night. It was cozy, but the shower and bathroom were wet when we arrived and the bed had multiple stains on it.",NEGATIVE
"As far as location goes - 100%, but as far as cleanliness goes, it left a lot to be desired. There weren’t any clean towels for us to use, and the shower looked like there was black mold. We ended up not showering after a full travel day which was disappointing. The sheets had stains so we slept on top of the beds rather than in them. All in all, with the proactive and positive way David communicated and the excellent location in old town, it wasn’t too bad. However, we wish the cleanliness reached what I would consider a basic level.",NEGATIVE
"A few things to consider... the apartment is very difficult to get up to with luggage. There are 3 flights of incredibly tight, steep, winding stairs. The apartment was relatively clear. It was free of clutter but was dusty, had a broken (internal - not facing the street but out to the stair case) window that was covered with newspaper. When we checked in the apartment had a strong sewage odor to it. We did not end up staying here - we left and got a hotel. The pictures on this page are of the apartment however, the pictures make it look FAR more comfortable than it is. This is the third time we have stayed in Gamla Stan, it is an older area so we knew what to expect - we were not expecting a new apartment. This is the only airbnb we have had this problem with.",NEGATIVE
"upon arrival I compared the pictures with the actual apartment. the pictures are indeed from the apartment but give a weigh better impression than the actual status Especially the bathroom/shower gave me the creeps, did not wash my hair during our 2-night-stay because I wanted to spend as little time as possible in that dark dirty-looking shower. Also the apartment has an open area with stuff piled up, including dirty wet towels. That area has a door with open windows (without windows)to what seems to be the dark elevator shaft. I don´t even want to think about what (or who?) can come in through that door. The advertisement says that it has central heating. It has the installation but it did not work. We contacted David who offered for a technician to come by the next day because the system was still shut down after summer. Nobody showed up and the heating did not work during our stay I could mention many more things. Price does not compensate for the state of the appartment",NEGATIVE
we have big luggages and there is no elevator :(,NEGATIVE
"David was not responsive to our call to fix the heater. My son was sick, so it was critical to get the heater fixed, did not respond to Airbnb rep. or our frequent text.",NEGATIVE
"We arrived at 5 pm. The flat was neither clean nor ready to move in for another 1,5 hours even though we arrived on our second day of our booking and communicated everything in advance. After the cleaning was ready the flat was still not very clean and with empty bottles. Both beds are broken, one nearly collapsed without even touching it. The shower door is broken, the shower was dirty, two lights are broken, the sofa had stains and animal hair (one of us is allergic). Apart from that it‘s still a cosy and price worthy apart and the location is really fantastic. The building has a nice charme and authentic ambient. Near by are wonderful historic restaurants, everything is quiet.The place was warm and fullfilled basic needs. It total ok for the price.",NEGATIVE
Excallent location but the host was not very communicative.,NEGATIVE
"Great value for money & amazing location. Apartment is up narrow stairs, don’t recommend if you have big suitcases. TV didn’t work, not a big issue as we didn’t want to spend much time watching TV. David didn’t respond when we sent an enquiry about this.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is fresh and modern and clean, but is as functionless as an Ikea showroom. It is very obvious that no-one has ever lived there and it is kept as an investment Airbnb only. There were no working smoke alarms, we found them in a cupboard. There is no toaster and no corkscrew. The kitchen was absolutely bare - not even the basics such as salt and pepper or cooking oil provided. There is a good Nespresso machine but no pods to get you started. There is no clothes airing rack. The front door bell was broken and there is no intercom to the downstairs outside door which makes key management difficult when there is only one key. Less of an issue in winter, but none of the curtains close properly because of the design and there is no blind on the side window in the smaller bedroom. The apartment is in a good location on the waterfront with a supermarket and multiple restaurants very close by. However, I wouldn’t stay here again as the apartment is poorly set up and managed.",NEGATIVE
"Didn't want to write this review because it is not going to be nice. There were many things wrong with this place. From very dirty cutlery placed next to the clean stuff, to super thin blankets in a cold Swedish climate and no instruction on which lockbox to check for the keys (there were many!). The weirdest thing was probably house rules. Quote from the rules: ""NO SOUND AFTER 22:00!!! (If any neighbors complain you will be thrown out without any money back!)"" There are so many things wrong with this rule... The floor in the apartment creaks so loudly, that you cannot move there without making a loud sound. Second, if any neighbors complain? Even if the complaints are untruthful? But most importantly, a rule like that should be public. The owner of the airbnb has every right to make any amount of stupid rules with unpleasant language they want. But then it should be my right to know about such rules before making a decision where to spend the money.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is as the photos show and the area is easy to walk to transports, but aside from Komet there really is nothing nearby. The main issue I had with my stay was the temperature inside the apartment, I checked-in and it was 26,5 °C inside. I asked and asked for it to be lowered but they refused to do so, even after I wasted the next morning waiting for someone that they said would come to fix it. I had to open the window, which is right above the bed, but the temperature when I close it quickly goes up. I slept very badly and the bed does not help. The communication was awful, they kept apologizing but did nothing. Also there were bugs already inside on the check-in and whenever I opened the window. Last thing, they give an overall list that has a bar nearby, Lemon Bar. I checked in late and it was the only place available to have food and a drink. Well, don't go there, just ask the locals why. A very generous 3 stars for the late check-out, location and airbnb support.",NEGATIVE
"Alicia was good but this particular place was awful. It smells garbage and drainage everywhere. The smell has Methane gas in it which is produced by septic sludge while nitrate is a byproduct of a failing septic system. These fumes are released through toilets, pipes, and drains, putting any inhabitant in serious danger.",NEGATIVE
"The flat is big and well situated, but not very confortable. The bathroom, toilet and kitchen are a bit run-down, which is not necessarily a problem, however the bedroom is very unconfortable. The mattress slops towards the middle and the pillows are in dire need of being changed. The cot was left on the small baby height and couldn't be lowered for our toddler and no proper cot bedding was made available, despite my request. The room has blinds, but they are not effective in preventing the sun from coming in. This might not be a problem for people without children, but it meant our child woke up everyday at 5am. As other guests have mentioned, internet doesn’t really work. Olof initially provided a wifi username and password that did not exist or was not available. He later gave us access to another wifi, but it barely worked. I don’t think there is any wifi proper in the flat, but rather access to another network in the building.",NEGATIVE
"This apartment is spacious and in a good location from the main areas of Stockholm. Olof was great a responding. Unfortunately, we were extremely cold at night and the heater was tiny and didn’t work. We woke up feeling sick because we didn’t have any heat overnight and we were only provided 1 blanket that didn’t warm us up enough. The pillows were also dull and not comfortable. Also do plants in the apartment as seen in the pictures. Definitely an older building.",NEGATIVE
"I really hated giving this host money. I had concerns before we arrived as I had asked about what curtains/ blinds are at the property and if the cot to be lowered to getting a textbook ‘apartment is as seen’ response. He also tried to constantly sell and early check in/ check out and cares more about money than a personable service. He didn’t provide any cot bedding or towels for our two infants despite messaging before check in to confirm this was needed. After much pestering on the 3rd night of our stay some were dropped off but it was too late. If an adult was missing linen it would have been taken more seriously I felt. Whilst there is an elevator at the property, there are multiple steps to get to the front door which is not made clear. There were also no instructions on where to take the bins out too and they are located at the back of the building a fair walk around the street. Additionally no dishwasher tablets are provided. Poor service overall, I wouldn’t return.",NEGATIVE
The apartment is very old and have not been renovated for probobly 50-60 years. The apartment is at a good location. The apartment was very dirty. The kitchen was so dirty i didnt want to use it. The bathroom was full of hairs and dirty spots everywhere. The bathroom also had insects that made it uncomfortable to use. When you wash your hands or brush your teeth the water have problems going down in the pipe. There also was a condom lying on the floor outside my bedroom and they didnt pick it up until my 3rd day staying there. When you shower you had to wait around 5 minutes before any warm water came. For my it was strange they didnt even bother to vacum all the dust from the floor in my bedroom before i arrived. They also didnt clean anything during my 3 nights stay there so it wasnt improved to make me feel better during my stay. In general i would not recomend this airbnb for others because what i experienced is not something that sould be aloud to rent out in airbnb for money.,NEGATIVE
HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!! Please do avoid. When we got there we waited 1.5 hour in the cold because the host wouldn't reply and had to contact airbnb help. The rules were outrageous for the terrible treatment we got.,NEGATIVE
"While the unit was as described and great, my experience was not ideal due to check in process and lack of response time. Despite confirming early check-in multiple times, the apartment was not ready—it was dirty, with uncleaned dishes, messy bedding etc, and I had to wait hours without resolution. The apartment was ready almost 3 hours after the promised time, leaving me exhausted and inconvenienced after an overnight flight. Further, lack of and confusing communication made this a highly frustrating experience. It was clear you were not communicating with a person and host but a property management team despite it being presented as a “host”. I often had to ask the same question multiple times, I got random messages that didn’t fit my stay, and it was generally confusing. I do not recommend booking with this team.",NEGATIVE
"The floor was filthy, so were the floor mats. When we checked in, the floor mat in the kitchen was so wet that my socks got wet. Kitchen bowls, plates, cups were so filthy that we had to wash them carefully even before we used them. The kitchen had some utensils and stuff, but still lacked very basic things like cooking oil, tissues/napkins, etc. We booked apartment for 4 people but there are only 2 spoons?!?! So my girlfriend and I had to wait for my parents to eat first and then wash the spoons so that we can eat after that. The communication during checkin and checkout was good and quick.",NEGATIVE
"the location is great. the house is good too. the bad part is that the host asked us to clean after ourselves (vacuum, wipe the surfaces, floors, etc) , which was very rude counting the fact that when we checked in, room wasn't in good condition. the lights were out mostly all the time, we had to fix it ourselves, because otherwise the room would get cold cuz it's basically in the basement. the bath was upstairs, and it was clogged and dirty. the reply time was around 2-3 hours, we couldn't turn on the heater, bc some of the sockets werent working, but untill the time she replied we figured it out. i can't say it was a bad experience, Katja and her boyfriend seemed very nice and willing to help whenever they want to, but i absolutely had much more better experiences in the past",NEGATIVE
The shower upstairs were however not all that comfortable but there were renovations ongoing.,NEGATIVE
"If you have difficulty with stairs then it could be tricky, very narrow bei the door.",NEGATIVE
"Anett’s place is super quirky and well designed, we liked the touches and furnishings however we felt a little like we were staying in a shop as there were quite a few items with price tags which made us nervous to sit down and touch things. We were also disappointed with the level of cleanliness and felt that the Airbnb could have been cleaned a little bit better upon arrival, especially the sink and bath. There is also a lack of convenient lighting and downstairs could have done with more options. We also felt the lack of blinds and curtains upstairs a bit off putting at night as anyone can look in, adding some curtains to the bedroom would definitely improve the stay. Anett’s place definitely has the potential to be an amazing Airbnb but we just felt that there were some slight improvements that could have made our stay more comfortable.",NEGATIVE
Very cluttered inside. Looks like it runs as a store sometimes. Faint odor in the lower level. Had a dirty towel in the bathroom. Generally was quite good though and made for interesting decor but was.... busy for sure. Main bedroom sliding slanted door does not cover the opening.,NEGATIVE
"I had a terrible experience with Manohar. He never answered my message, he was not there to check me in, his phone to contact was not his number. I was outside waiting for 2 hours. Don’t trust!",NEGATIVE
"The space itself was clean and very comfortable, and the check-in process was well described, and came with very easy to follow instructions which included pictures. Unfortunately the stay was ended in a very stressful and upsetting way. We asked our host the day before we were due to check out if late check out would be possible - we were told that it was, and received explicit approval to check out at 1pm instead of 11am. At 11am a cleaner entered the apartment, and was extremely angry with us. She did not seem to be able to speak English, or perhaps she didn't want to. She demanded that we call our host, which we were not able to do as we booked via Airbnb. We messaged our host who replied that late check-out was no longer possible, due to a ""building inspector"" coming to visit. If we had been told this even at 9 or 10am, we could have absolutely checked-out at 11, but we received NO notice at all about this change of plans. We completed all of the tasks that the check-out protocol listed (stripping the bed linen, washing dishes etc) anyway, and left as soon as we had completed them. When we left, the cleaner swore at us under her breath - how professional! This situation was entirely avoidable, all we needed was to have this information shared with us as soon as our host found this out. It really left a sour, stressful end to our trip",NEGATIVE
"Pros: Peaceful area, bathroom spacious, beds are okay, kitchen facility is good, you replied to my questions promptly, Near by lake is a good spot Cons: Less spacious for 4 members, we felt like a sweat room. We could not use balcony (it was locked permanently). Your instructions to use apartment can be made more clear. I see lots of dust in the bottom of the coat/bed, even on the walls. Cup boards are not enough to keep things of 4 members. We also found bugs in the bed and in bathroom, I have a video of it (if you want I can send). I also see that there is no stand to keep shower gel in the shower area.",NEGATIVE
"I was looking forward to stay at this place for long term, but the place was different from how it was described and I left. The hosts art and craft items were all over the room (shelf, cabinet, floor) and the host works as an artist so the room was not exactly a private room as advertised, also no key. The photos were not showing the parts of the room where all these items were stored. My short stay was overall a bad experience and the host made me uncomfortable as they wanted to come with me to the other side of the city after arriving to pick up my other packages. I also felt that it is not enough to request that I don't want to eat, they asked me multiple times until I agreed. I also had to wait around 20 minutes outside in the cold to get in as the host was not answering my messages and I couldn't get in the building until the neighbour let me in. I am quite sad that this became an uncomfortable experience instead of staying there, but the host was fair and returned my money.",NEGATIVE
"I was satisfied with the apartment and Hannah communicated well. But I got confused, when she asked me to help clean up the apartment for the next guest. She said that she doesnt have time to properly clean it and needs help to take the sheets out. I dont think that it is my responsibility and I started to wonder if the apartment was cleaned well before my visit there.",NEGATIVE
"First of all, Tore is a really nice host - very friendly and responsive. It was not a self check-in so we had to coordinate when we arrive. The location is great - very central, connected and safe. There is even a small supermarket in the same building. However, we were not impressed with the flat. It was clean but not kitted out properly. The biggest downside is the bed - it's too small for 2 people. Same with the duvet - too small. It was hot so we had to open a window (there is no fan) which made it more noisy (on top of a slight fridge noise). Windows have blinds but not blackouts so it was very bright in the morning - we had to sleep with sleep masks and ear plugs - we didn't rest well at all. There is disposable tableware but it really needs proper mugs, cutlery and plates with bowls. There is no large mirror in the flat. We stayed for 4 nights and only had 1 roll of toilet paper in the flat. If the flat is renovated and properly kitted out, it can be a great place to stay.",NEGATIVE
"The flat is well located and the check-in is easy. The appartment was clean as well. But: The shower was with burning hot water only and it wasn't possible to make it colder. We contacted the host about this topic at the first evening. During the whole stay (6days) I just got kinda worthless messages, but noboday appeared to fix it or anything else happened. Almost one week without showering in this category of appartment is just a bad joke.",NEGATIVE
This listing is a SCAM. Do not fall for this fraudulent host! One of the worst experiences I ever had on this platform.. Luckily I was able to get a refund from Airbnb. Do not trust any of Anna’s listings.,NEGATIVE
"All good, small apart for max 2 people. Bathroom not comfortable, too small and nothing for leaving your stuff (shelf, etc)",NEGATIVE
"The location and place itself were beyond incredible. However, we had countless issues with communicating with the host. The keys were not in the lockbox when we arrived which meant we were stuck outside waiting for about 2 hours until 10pm for them to provide a new key. Once in the unit we realized there was only one role of toilet paper for 4 people staying 5 days. It took the host 2 days to respond and he told us to look in a storage location outside of the unit, we ended up needing to just buy our own at that point. Lastly, there were not enough towels for the amount of people staying and I messaged him multiple times about this and he simply never addressed it causing us to share towels. It’s a shame that the host was the challenge here since the place itself was truly great and I would have recommended it if not for the numerous difficulties with the host we faced.",NEGATIVE
"While this place was GORGEOUS aesthetically and an excellent location in Gamla Stan, there were serious plumbing issues. We reported the slow shower/tub right away on day 1 of our 7 day stay and that there was a foul smell in the hall bathroom. The following night the bathroom flooded after a quick shower. The hall bathroom odor continued to get worse and then the dishwasher wouldn't work. We communicated all of this to the host and he said he would send someone by. We spent an entire morning waiting to ""hear back"" about someone coming to fix the plumbing and no one came - which also meant we missed out on an entire morning of exploring the city. We were there for 7 days and no one came to fix the plumbing and no apology for the inconveniences we experienced despite repeated follow ups on our end. Everything else was comfortable and homey. The home could use more dish & bath towels since we had 4 adults for a week - we had to do laundry 3x to have enough towels.",NEGATIVE
"Huuuge apartment on 3 levels from basement to street to first floor. Greta kitchen with all the tools to make a great meal, Lego for the kids, Playstation for the older kids, even a guitar which was mostly in tune! The only downside is that you are on the ground floor of a secluded narrow alley, which is usually empty, but if a bunch of drinks decide to have a debate just under your windows it's not a very nice experience (happened once on our first night, we asked them to move and since then everything was quiet.). Awesome location and a very decent price. Highly highly recommend",NEGATIVE
"Great location for such a price. Comfortable large bed, two toilets, comfortable kitchen, the apartment is large and pleasant. The cleaning is not the best. The windows were dirty, there was broken glass on the balcony, the sinks were not completely cleaned. The owner answers quickly, but so formally that it seemed like you were communicating with a robot. There is a laundry room, but it is dirty and very inconvenient to use: one key for several apartments for laundry reservations.",NEGATIVE
I couldn’t practise violin at the place. They called me from Airbnb that the noise level at the place is too loud while there was no complaint from the neighbours and some of them was practising a clarinet/saxophone also another day. So have that in mind booking the place.,NEGATIVE
"Nice apartment, great locatiom, helpfull host Shower did not work very well. Two beds are not very big",NEGATIVE
Bathroom shower was some how stocked and water was overflowing. Could not do much about it,NEGATIVE
"In all other Airbnb I have stayed at there has always been a hand towel, bath towel and face cloth per person. I stayed in this home alone. I was left with one (1) hand towel to dry myself and my shoulder length hair. This was a problem! There is no privacy in the main living space. The apartment faces many others and there is no kitchen window covering and mostly sheer living room drapes. You needed to be fully dressed when entering these rooms. Otherwise the unit was clean and very comfortable. The owner was responsive and helpful with the checking in and out.",NEGATIVE
We got a lot of noice complaints without having music being too loud or late at night.,NEGATIVE
Its a great apartment in a great location but our stay was spoiled by leaving soiled bedclothes in the washing machine which smelt awful and then we received no response when we complained which is really disappointing.,NEGATIVE
"Overall a bit disappointing. Only pluses : no key needed so no bothering with key sharing (useful when you're 8), the nice terrasse, and the quietness of the flat despite being super central. But so much little annoyances accumulating! One room doesn't have stores on the window, which means it's bright day light at 3 o'clock. 2 beds are super noisy at the slightest movement. No storage whatsoever for clothes. Not a single hanger. Nowhere to keep stuff in the bathroom either. The floor was super dirty when we got there, but no mob available. Had to get on my knees and clean with a sponge to get some sticky stains away. No curtain in the shower. No Iron. Building doesn't seem to sort of trash (bit weird considering it's Sweden). Owners more or less interested in helping out. (Said after 5 h ""there should be a mob"" and that was it) Might be a good place if you stay one night as a group for some some reason but not appropriated for longer stays. Myself I wouldn't come back here again",NEGATIVE
centrally located and comfortable place. the interior is very basic but interesting architecturally. communication was often very delayed and some questions not answered. they will not be flexible at all with bad storage and sent us to a place that was no longer open to store our bags. there is no bag storage close to their place which made for a challenging morning with our luggage.,NEGATIVE
"Clear and simple instructions on how to check in and check out. Great location, wonderful view and a great apartment to stay in. However, while it was nice and warm upstairs in the apartment, it was freezing downstairs in the kitchen. There was an air pump in each room but only one remote control that worked only in one of the bedrooms. There were no instructions on how to use any of the electrical equipment in the apartment. We couldn't unlock and use the stove either. I never got a reply from the host when I sent her a message about the freezing kitchen.",NEGATIVE
"Ok apartment in a good location. I didn't like the check-in vibe with a strange man with strange vibe receiving the guests inside the place, asking unappropriate questions and overexplaining silly rules for the place. Also he stays overwatching the place, and when the check-out time comes he will be at the door with his ugly face in front of you. The building also has a strange vibe. The elevator is tiny and old. Overall I'd say the place has a bit strange vibe.",NEGATIVE
"A dreadful experience. During our stay, the locks on the outside door of the apartment building were changed. There were warnings plastered all over the building to not let in people due to risk of burglary. The keys and fob stopped working. I contacted the host at 16:58 to highlight this issue. This issue was not addressed appropriately by the host until 21:20 and I was given the number of a random man - allegedly the partner of the air bnb host to FaceTime outside of the app. He was not any help and nonchalant on the phone. The host did not address this serious issue for 5 hours. We were outside the apartment for an hour begging residents to let us into an apartment we paid for. We were finally let in after an hour in the cold and rain by a resident who took pity on us. It is disturbing the host did not know of such an integral aspect of the property they were renting out. This ruined our holiday. Someone was sent by the host at 22:10 after she was told at 17:00.",NEGATIVE
First of all I did't knew that the host is living with guest .. I don't often read comments but that's it! He waited us to arrive very late at night and as a surprize our sun decided 9h before that he wants to come. Been more focused on the plane ticket I forgot to notifiy Goran but we sort it out - he's a thankful person The only thing that bothered me A LOT was the fact that on the day of departure he came along at 3:03am and slamed some door - my wife got scared. But I still recommend this place.,NEGATIVE
"The good: location, lots of natural light, clean, large bed, visually attractive furnishings. The not so good: This is not a duplex but rather an apartment in a three or four story building. Nor is it a one bedroom but rather an efficiency with a sleeping loft. The unit begs for a handyman. The toilet seat is loose, the bathroom sink does not drain unless one takes the stopper out. There are no instructions on the use of the washer, dryer, or other appliances. We could not figure out how to turn all of the lights off. It felt like we had an invisible roommate who had hogged all the closet and drawer space. We could not unpack. There were three rather old bath towels and two small hand towels. No extra linens. We have stayed in many airbnb's and homeaways with good success. This was not, unfortunately, one of the best.",NEGATIVE
"All good, the soap dispenser did not work, aside from that all as advertised.",NEGATIVE
"Starting with the positives: the water pressure was great, it had a freezer, was close to public transportation and a grocery store, the beds were comfortable, and the building felt safe. Unfortunately, the stay was still overall quite unpleasant. They told us there would be no air conditioning, but did not mention that there would be no way to open the windows or circulate the air at all. It was suffocating and very warm, and the smell of the cleaning products lingered, inducing headaches for multiple days. When we messaged the host asking for a way to get some air into the apartment, they did not ever reply. Though the beds were comfortable, it was difficult to sleep well because it was so hot and uncomfortable to breathe the stale air. The apartment was also very dirty when we got there. The floors and the main bed both had dirt/dark dust on them. Overall, we would not recommend this apartment for a stay in Stockholm.",NEGATIVE
"Pros - 1. Great location (Close to transportation and seemed very safe). 2. Quiet area. 3. The picture matches the place. Cons - 1. We were never sent instructions on how to check in. We had to call to get the instructions. 2. Airbnb is not utilized by the company. You have to call or email them to get a response, and there can be times when they don’t answer the phone. Additionally, the email responses are delayed. 3. The kitchen vent was dirty and the inability to open windows is not ideal. Overall this place would be great once the company gets a dedicated person to respond to Airbnb guests.",NEGATIVE
"Pros: Accommodation looked just like the photos. Cons: No ventilation, windows don’t open, no fan. Coffee machine but no coffee provided? Mugs still had stickers on them, hadn’t even been washed. Cutlery dirty. Some plug sockets didn’t work. Only communicate via email, don’t use Airbnb.",NEGATIVE
"Exactly met expectations. Unfortunately, there were very loud noises from the ventilation at night, which really disturbed our sleep.",NEGATIVE
"The room was well equipped and the location good for getting to central. The room was very hot though and even after having this checked out the dryness of the property was a struggle. Read the fine print ""the windows don't open"". This makes the room very dry as the temperature is set between 19-23 and can't be adjusted. This did make sleeping and relaxing difficult. ApartDirect responded in 24hours to have the temperature lowered but I still struggled with the dryness. If you don't mind warm and dry it looked as it should have and was convenient.",NEGATIVE
Quiet location and easy and fast to get there. Nice neighborhood with shops and restaurants . Heater could not be regulated and it was not possible to open the windows to get some fresh air so it was very hot in the apartment. Floor was a bit dusty as well and the bathroom was not well cleaned.,NEGATIVE
"Apartment was clean and like in the description. Is it near the centrum. Problem was cold air from ventilation, which the host solved with heater, but he turned on without our presence at the accomodation and it was not correct! Other problem was with keycode to the building after check-out. We put our suitcase in the locker as we were flying out in the evening and we couldn’t get into the building.",NEGATIVE
"Pros: Wifi was good, bed was comfortable, felt safe. Easy to check in with a pin code. Provided towels. Good water pressure. Quiet area around. Cons: There was no sponges/soap to wash the dishes, yet if we don't leave the dishes clean, we are fined. There was no dishwasher. There was no shampoo or conditioner. No Air conditioner. The shower was a problem because the water leaks from under it and gets the entire bathroom floor soaking wet. No check out directions, whether we were to take out the trash or put sheets in laundry etc.",NEGATIVE
"clean place, easily accessible, good comms by the host & in nice neighborhood. only downside was that there were boards everywhere indicating how you'll be fined for doing something or not doing something in the room, which I thought was a bit hostile.",NEGATIVE
There was no opportunity to open the windows. Only an air conditioner which was running constantly (and pretty loud throughout the night) and which could not be turned off.,NEGATIVE
"Clean apartment, but the elevator didn’t work the entire time so that we had to walk up and down the 4th floor.",NEGATIVE
"I DO NOT recommend this host to anyone. The host (a person named Theodore) behaved very disrespectfully, unprofessional, and unfairly towards me. To briefly summarize my story: I booked this the night before my trip. The host refused to provide the entry code, claiming I needed to verify my identity. This despite having done so multiple times on the host's site via mobil bank ID. Nevertheless, he asked for a photo of my passport. I refused as Swedish passports contain confidential information. I wanted to cancel the reservation. The host did not refund the payment, stating he was not obliged to do so according to Airbnb's rules. Even though he knew that I had booked the apartment just a few minutes before. I contacted Airbnb. They tried contacting the host but received no response. Ultimately, I was forced to send a photo of my passport to them to receive the entry code. Unfortunately, this host, when not obliged to return your money, will behave very inappropriately towards you.",NEGATIVE
"Very quiet, suburban location. Easy to get downtown or fun neighbourhoods via metro or buses - well connected and frequent. The bed was not made up in the master bedroom so I had to use the one in the living room. It wouldn’t have been so bad if I was able to block out the sun for a decent sleep..! Kitchen amenities are basic but enough for light meal prep. Tips for Stockholm - download the SL app to buy tickets for the metro/bus. Do not take a taxi from Arland airport - it’s unbelievably expensive and unnecessary. There are easy and affordable transit options to take you direct to Stockholm.",NEGATIVE
"the location and check-in system were excellent. But the place was too much cold (the room, bathroom and kitchen) without appropriate heating systems. so i don't recommend it for the cold season.",NEGATIVE
Its close to the metro and the middle of the city but we did not have heater in the room. Bathroom was also strange. We missed also the window.,NEGATIVE
the place is terrible,NEGATIVE
This is a scam. The host was non responsive. Do not book here. It is fake.,NEGATIVE
I didn't realize that it was only a small room without lock in the door. So it wasn't convinient for me.,NEGATIVE
They email you outside of Airbnb so do not expect a message explaining this. The entire point of Airbnb is being able to do everything inside of the app but to find the check in instructions you need the emails. Unless you message them inside of Airbnb you will never get a message from them here. You are renting from a corporation so do not expect any personal service. It is a large apartment building that has no people to help you there. Phone support is a call center so I had to wait for a free person to speak with. You have to upload your passport to their website to get the check in instructions and door codes. I did not receive them so I had to call and wait.,NEGATIVE
"Pros: clean, spacious, fairly conveniently located. What you see is what you get. Comfortable bed. Decent shower. Quiet. Cons: temperature/air is centrally controlled. There is air blowing out of the very large unit on the ceiling literally at all times&it can’t be turned off. The unit faces the bed. Me&my husband had sinus pain due to the air continuously blowing at us during the night. When trying to contact their support team I was initially met with very little willingness to help resolve the issue. The person on the phone was quite dismissive and kept pointing me towards the electric heater in the cupboard. I kept explaining that the temperature was not the problem but the airflow was. I eventually wrote to them via email (we received no response via the airbnb app) and had a slightly better experience there where they actually tried to help. Not much came of it but at least they tried.",NEGATIVE
"A good place to stay in Stockholm. It is located in a good place, quite area and it is easy to find. It was clean, but only one thing that I did not like was the heating. It was hot and as a result I could not sleep very well.",NEGATIVE
"The shower is not ok to use. The water goes on the floor, we ended up washing our heads in the bathroom sink because otherwise there would be water on all the floor, how others should use the restroom after that? There were 4 of us and showering part was REALLY problematic. Also there was almost no shower gel (which was maybe also shampoo?), it was not enough for our 2 day stay.",NEGATIVE
"The location of this Airbnb is truly amazing, offering easy access to many walkable attractions. Unfortunately, my experience here was disappointing, and I can’t recommend this place. First, guests are required to upload personal information to a separate website, which the host claims is due to Swedish law. However, none of the other Airbnbs I stayed at required this. The property is also extremely noisy, with loud disturbances and cigarette smoke near the front entrance. Additionally, there’s a sign warning that failing to wash dishes will result in extra charges—despite already paying a cleaning fee, which feels unnecessary. The Wi-Fi was unreliable, working only about half the time, which was frustrating. Lastly, the hosts seem to charge for every minor request, such as a modest hour late checkout. While the location is fantastic, these issues detracted from what could have been a much better experience.",NEGATIVE
"Unfortunately I did not have the best experience at the flat. After getting keys in a box, the electricity was not working when entering the flat. The freezer and floor was full of water. I had to clean up. The person on the phone was a friend of the host who did not have time to answer. Ultimately it got fixed after a couple of hours. Microwave was missing. Got fixed with a new one 2 days later. A pan was broken. After a few days, scaffholdings were built in front of the windows with workers starting from 7am every day... I got compensation of 20% from the host but it killed my stay. Otherwise the flat is OK. The kitchen and bathroom are dated but the rest is fine and the bedroom with sofa upstairs cute. Pity that there is no TV, especially for long stays. The host was not flexible when I asked for a late check out despite no booking. She asked me to book another night instead to stay a couple of hours more... I refused obviously and left at 11am. So, not the best AirBnB experience :/",NEGATIVE
"Thanks for hosting me and my friends. We found a clean flat with comfortable beds. Also, check-in and check-out were very easy thanks to the instructions. One star deduction because of the unpleasant smell from the house (cooked rice and garlic) and the lack of possibility to ventilate. Even in the bathroom. All windows can not be opened and the fans do not clean the air. Especially for a larger group or a longer stay, this is an issue. It’s also worth to mention: the smallest bed room has no daylight and no possibly to organize your luggage (a chair or clothes hook would have been nice).",NEGATIVE
"Avoid this listing! Unbearable sewage smell + terrible host: 1. When I checking in, foud that unused toilet drainage hole emits a strong septic tank odor: Video evidence confirms this. Despite host attempts to mask it with Rituals incense, the smell persisted and spread throughout the listing. 2. Baseless accusations by host: Ida didn't solve the problem but accused me of lying about the smell because of being unable to afford the rent. She should be ashamed. Even did not confirm to get refund, I opted to check out on next morning to escape the bad smell and booked a more expensive hotel. 3. Unfair appeal for remaining balance from Host: Airbnb support refunded me, but Ida falsely claimed I mentioned the smell issue until late night. Message records refute this claim. And Ida accused me a lier again to escape payment. 4. Further humiliation: Ida accused me of theft for relocating Rituals' incense to drawer to alleviate nausea from the remix of septic tank odor and perfume",NEGATIVE
"It was a lot of people hanging out around my room the woman that checks you has a very bad attitude and is a very rude, she called her husband and son even to shout at us just because she thinks there’s one more person in the room, the whole family family came out to talk as the live near our room is just separated by one door not secure, her husband was screaming all the time even he was trying to hit us it was really terrible time we told him we will call to the police but he was still disturbing us then the women let us pay extra money for two nights for another person who doesn’t exists, The tv doesn’t work. I didn’t like anything this place was so disgusting, bugs everywhere horrible customer services , worst experience ever, do not ever wast your money!.",NEGATIVE
"The stay was overall good, Karin was easy to communicate with and the check-in experience was smooth. The location was very good: very close to Stockholm center, close to nature, and there is a park for kids few steps away from the house (very convenient for families with kids). Nevertheless the house was not as clean as: dirty fridge, stains on bedsheets, stains on towels which was very disappointing to me. The extra double bed on the basement is very small and not convenient for 2 persons. The option for sleeping in the basement is not convenient for more than one night. I would say with the current setup the house is convenient for 3 persons for a good stay.",NEGATIVE
"Communication with the host is good, and the location is close to all services. There is a problem with lighting and the quality of the Wi-Fi, which covers the garden. There are many bees on the balcony. Cleaning tools are not available, and food preparation tools are not available.",NEGATIVE
Property very clean and high ceilings. The only problem was the fact the “sofa bed” for the 5th person is just a sofa and not a bed - so difficult if 5 people are staying,NEGATIVE
Host very reactive and flexible. Flat position ideal: close to the center and to the metro. Main issue: the cleanliness. The kitchen in particular was not clean and quite messy. The bathroom is very very very small.,NEGATIVE
Host was communicative but location seemed a bit far off from city center and quite a few stops from main terminal. Room was a bit clumsy and was narrow. No windows hence no air outlet to ventilate. Room door is only place for ventilation but have to sacrifice your privacy if you need some air. When the host burned pizza in home felt a bit of air suffocation in this room as the room door need to be opened due to burnt air smell floating inside. Utensils available are very limited. The pillow was quite hard and uncomfortable to sleep tho.,NEGATIVE
Very hard to communicate with Hannah. Unclear as to whether she wanted to host us.,NEGATIVE
"Ther only hit h was getting the key at the beginning because we didn't know what she meant by ""keyhide"" (we know it as a lockbox) and then we weren't smart enough to open it at first.",NEGATIVE
"Early August visit. Good: location is convenient, host representative is pleasant and responsive, and the living room is spacious and well-appointed. Not-good: check-in was a disaster - arriving at the agreed time, the unit was dirty and we waited outdoors in the cold rain for 3 hours for a ""cleaning"". The kitchen is very dated, 1980s-era worn cabinets and warped formica, broken coffee pot and no freezer. Bathrooms are similar, with a tiny plastic shower, yellowed, scuffed linoleum flooring and sad dim lighting. No closets and no TV in the unit. Two of the three bedrooms have windows into the unit - severely reducing privacy. The unit was priced at the highest end of the market and we expected much more - we had friends renting a similar apartment a few blocks away that was considerably cheaper but very modern, spacious and very clean. We’re sorry to leave a review like this but we've been renting in Stockholm for more than 20 years and this was a big disappointment.",NEGATIVE
"This place is easy to access, 7-10mins walk from metro station or take a bus outside the station, only 3 stops. There are food places and convenience shops nearby. Our biggest problem is the whole house is too cold for us in the winter nights. There are heaters but some of the windows don't shut well eg. the kitchen windows, so cold air sips through. Cannot enjoy some peaceful time watching TV in the living room as it's too cold. Had to close bedroom door to block the cold when we sleep. Communicated with the host about it but due to central heating in the building, there's little that they can do. The housekeeping needs improvement too as the floor was dusty when we checked in and had to vacuum it ourselves. We also found a piece of left over snack between the sofa cushions. Overall, a nice place to stay in for short term visit.",NEGATIVE
"The bed was broken and collapsed every night. Despite the fact that we asked him to repair the bed every day, Olof only replied with a standardised message that he didn't have anyone who could repair the bed and tried to contact someone. However, the problem was not raised.",NEGATIVE
generally decent living space with nice living room decor but host only provides half a roll of toilet paper even with multiple guests over multiple days. some equipment / sofa bed also seemed old/rusty,NEGATIVE
"Quality according to expectations, very low key simple standard but works well if you work in the area and just need to spend some nights and don’t want to get ruined. Smooth self checkin process although it said access from 3pm it then changed to 4pm in the following info and instructions. A minus was that they got complicated when one of my vest friends just wanted to come by and say hello when he was in the area and they became quite rude which didn’t leave a very good overall impression.",NEGATIVE
This stay never happened. It was like a bot accepted my reservation right away and I never got a response when I tried to call or message about checking in.,NEGATIVE
The single worst check in experience I have ever had. They kept repeating the same email asking for additional documents to provide my check in. I responded and they kept sending the same thing despite me completing it. Took more than an hour past check in and help from Airbnb to get into the appt. I ended up missing a meeting because it took so long to get in. There were multiple people at the property having the same issue as well. I was then locked out in the middle of the night for over an hour because their lock stopped working for their front door and the support took a very long time to fix it. Apartment itself was tiny but fine. I would never rebook this property or with this host.,NEGATIVE
They never gave me check in instructions. They did not message me back. Airbnb could not get in contact with them. They had a cumbersome 3rd party ID verification system that was annoying. I had to demand a refund and find another hotel last minute. Would definitely never make a reservation with them again.,NEGATIVE
"Having access to a working internet connection is essential to most travels today. For business travelers it is ESSENTIAL. The internet connection in the Forenom APH is certainly NOT reliable. NOT consistent. Almost NOT existing. With absolutely no hotel staff present it is challenging to find cause and resolution. However, all that was promised was internet connection. Nowhere did the statement state the connection would be functional and consistent. So I had a learning experience.",NEGATIVE
"Communication was slow and insufficient, as well as there being a problem with the door which was left unnoticed. Overall my stay was not pleasant.",NEGATIVE
"Everything was fine except the lack of cleaning. When we arrived, it had not been cleaned and there were hairs in the bed, the kitchen was very smelly and the kitchen utensiles hadn’t been cleaned in a long time. I told the hosts that it was unacceptable and we had to sleep somewhere else that night. They cleaned it the next day, but the flat was not avaikable until 16.00pm, so we were unable to use the flat for 1 and a half days. They were professional enough to give us an extra day for the hassle. So the communication was good, but they really have to improve their cleaning.",NEGATIVE
Doesn’t provide hairdryer.,NEGATIVE
The apartment was really too hot during the day and it was uncomfortable stay. Would have been better if some kind of air conditioning was provided,NEGATIVE
The place didn't match the picture. They are an aparthotel so the room they show may not be the exact room you will get. The description is similar but not the same.,NEGATIVE
"An nice apartment located in a cozy family friendly neighborhood not too far from Stockholm city. What brings down the rate was the lack of basic kitchen supplies like salt, pepper and dishwasher tablets.",NEGATIVE
The place is nicely located and well decorated but there were stains on the bed sheets and it was really dusty,NEGATIVE
"Unfortunately this was a really bad experience for me and I had to shorten my stay after spending 1 night. A bad smell came out of the bathroom drains that spread throughout the studio. Missing lights in kitchenette and bed area. Limited heated water. Ceiling that is entirely in concrete which does not match the pictures, and gives a restricted feeling. I hope these issues can be solved to avoid unpleasant stays for future guests.",NEGATIVE
"Elías is very active and friendly and helpful. However I need to mention that this is really strange neighbourhood and I would not want to go out for walk later in evening around alone. There was strict rules on the noise but we listened to couples arguing under our window all night long and other night some lady yelling from her apartment. Strict smoking policy but we have been viewing the piles of cigarettes butts in front of neighbours door from the window. Lets mention that this is not owners fault and I do not feel like that is his responsibility - but it is strange that it is expected from guests while others are doing all these things. The accomodation is fairly simple and pictures looked better - but for the price I think it is perfectly fine and that price also makes up for the need of taking fast showers. Somehow this whole apartment complex reminds me of cages. Every door , one apartment. It is great to come in evening, sleep, take shower and get out again by car to city.",NEGATIVE
The place looked like the photos and Elias gave clear instructions about checking in which was really helpful. Unfortunately there was only a small pan and a pot which made cooking really hard.,NEGATIVE
"I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with this Airbnb stay due to a disastrous late-night check-in experience. Despite informing the host of our 2:00 AM arrival, the provided key box was empty, leaving us stranded on a frigid night. Numerous attempts to contact the host went unanswered, and we spent the night on the street, with no acknowledgment of responsibility from the host. This lack of communication and failure to provide a key soured our stay, and we seek a prompt resolution and compensation for this distressing experience.He ruined our stay,we spent a horrible night on the street, and he didn't even apologize!!!! We're not sure if it's a scam, be careful, don't stay at his place",NEGATIVE
The host was good. Quick answers to questions. A big disappointment was that the hot water quickly ran out.,NEGATIVE
No hot water. Do not expect to have a shower longer than 2-3 minutes before the water becomes ice cold. I did not find this out until I entered the apartment and read the note on the door.,NEGATIVE
"Had to shower with freezing cold water, the room was smaller than expected and there wasn’t even a ceiling light in the room. The shower curtain was ripped up and dirty and we barely got any toilet paper. The view was ugly and it was just overly underwhelming.I would not recommend coming here even for the cheap price.",NEGATIVE
"Very nice host. He was quick to respond and provided clear, detailed instructions on how to get to the spot. The apartment was clean but VERY cold. There was a space heater but it didn’t help much. The floor was absolutely freezing. If I knew it’s going to be that cold I would probably bring a pair of slippers. On top of that the blankets were paper thin. We had to sleep fully clothed as there was no additional set of blankets. The cold ruined our experience but the apartment is good for the price.",NEGATIVE
The place was ok. A little underwhelming compared to pictures. It was a student accommodation essentially. The main issue that there was no lighting. There was a light near the entrance to the apartment and the main lighting of the whole room was a lamp. Yes a lamp and the issue was not sorted,NEGATIVE
It was a short but nice stay for me. Only complaint is that the sound insulation is not very good.,NEGATIVE
"The apartment is not for sensitive sleepers. There’s no AC or normal airflow so it gets hot and a bit stuffy inside in hotter months because the only way to get more air in (window opens just a bit and it’s facing the sun all day so gets quite hot inside) is by opening the front door which feels not like a solution for privacy and so on. There’s also vents in the wall next to windows and outside door (which for some reason are not in apartment pictures…) that are literally holes covered with a little bit of plastic with no sound insulation, so that basically means you can hear outside quite well and although it’s in a pretty calm and nice area if you’re more sensitive sleeper you’ll hear a lot of things from the outside. Other than the plastic ventilation holes the apartment looks just like in pictures.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment was excellent and Elias was a great host. Unfortunately the neighbours made us feel uncomfortable with loads of noise at unsocial hours. There was clearly a drug and alcohol problem amongst the neighbours due to their behaviour. We witnessed women knocking on every door of the complex at 3am in the morning, a man laying on the concrete floor outside I his apartment in the middle of the afternoon, early morning screeching for no reason. Disappointing because the apartment was good quality.",NEGATIVE
"Good place to stay and good location. But pillows were very bad, dirty and cheap.",NEGATIVE
"Since my first stay here, it has been taken over by another company as well as Airbnb and although the place is nice for the price, I was asked to complete tasks violating Airbnb policies several times such as submitting ID on external sites and links to my social media for my booking to be accepted. When pointed out this was in violation, he was still insistent. When an issue appeared with the apartment, although initially seemed happy to help, nothing came of this and was left with the issue for the whole stay. First stay was 5/5 but since the new management it has gone down hill.",NEGATIVE
"The pictures were very well taken… because the place didn’t looked anything like that. Also, the interior was bad described. The description sayed. There would be hot water, the hot water supply was just for around 4 minutes. Also there were no kitchen towels and very minimalistic dishes. The described parking spaced weren’t there either, in general it was very difficult finding any place to park. Even though the house rules sayed, that smoking was forbidden, everything smelled like smoke, especially the bathroom. You couldn’t even let some fresh air inside, because it EVERYWERE smelled like smoke. In addition to that, the walls were very thin, we could hear our neighbors talk and sleep… the surrounding wasn’t very considerate. We would not stay there again, and wouldn’t recommend staying there either.",NEGATIVE
"Personally, If I could I'd give you 2 stars due to the lack of support and the photos didn't match the reality. I was disappointed how on the photos the cars were parked at the building, when we had to park in a car park for a high charge. Also, at night it was impossible to sleep due to extremely noisy neighbours and people hanging outside our door. Construction on site started early in the morning and there were a lot of drunk people walking around. There's not enough water for 2 people which the room is made to host .We wouldn't recommend anyone to come here after what we experienced",NEGATIVE
"The accommodation looked alright at first, but I had a terrifying experience there. Shortly after checking in late, around 9:30 PM to 10:00 PM, the power went out completely in the studio multiple times. I heard men outside the accommodation talking and trying to get in as soon as the lights went off. It was very scary and unexpected. After the power went out a couple more times, I decided to leave the accommodation and had my family escort me out because I didn’t feel safe at all. The place was very isolated and remote. I contacted the host later, once I had time to process what had happened that night. The response I received felt like an excuse, as I wasn’t given any prior notice or explanation by the host. All in all it was terrible",NEGATIVE
"I would like to complain about what I would consider the most important area in a studio in this Cold city, the shower obviously, it was warm, almost cold, but for sure, way to cold compare to the weather outside, when you go home exhausted from a long day, all you want is to take an hot and comfortable shower, which wasn’t possible because not only the water wasn’t hot enough but also, it was getting completely cold after only 4 minutes which is not acceptable at all; I would say that it totally ruined my stay, I stayed at the place 3 weeks, so I let you imagine, plus it’s not well isolated and the floor is really cold. I’m very not satisfied and I do not want anyone to have to experience it.",NEGATIVE
I did not have a good experience with this rental and cancelled it upon opening the door. I arrived after dark and did not feel safe in the area. I waited and came back in the daytime. I did not feel safe during the day and when I opened the door I was met with a horrible odor. The interior did not match the photos. I closed the door and cancelled the stay.,NEGATIVE
"Strange Vibe. Felt kind of abandoned. Therefore it was quiet at night. Elevator wasn't working. For the price alright, but don't expect too much.",NEGATIVE
Decent value for price but not great location.,NEGATIVE
The place was too hot in the nights and couldn’t sleep well. No fan or A/c. The lack of sleeping doesn’t help for travelers on the next day and it make me tired. Also there was no kettle for making a coffee. It would be great the place had more equipment.,NEGATIVE
It’s too bad that the curtain for the left window is stuck on the right side therefore we had the lights from outside bothering us at night. Also we were short on hot water like 2 or 3 times during our holidays.,NEGATIVE
"The place looks like the pictures, but there are a few caveats. First, the floor everywhere is concrete and cold. It took a lot of time for the apartment to warm up, and it was painfully cold to walk until I bought slippers. This is especially noticeable in the bathroom, which is the furtherest from the only heater. Limited supply of hot water doesn't make it better either: no long hot showers. Second, the kitchen is poorly equipped. No cattle, no microwave, no coffee maker; pans are few and small, no lid on the frying pan. I had to buy temporary stuff to make my stay bearable.",NEGATIVE
please fix the heater,NEGATIVE
"The apartment we rented leaves much to be desired. The strong point of the place is certainly the location - a quiet place, proximity to the metro station and grocery stores. Unfortunately, the apartment itself was not cleaned very well, what's more, in the photos it looks solid - unfortunately it is not. Contact with the host, location and price are a plus. I would not recommend this place for a longer stay.",NEGATIVE
"The only good thing for me was the price, and for sure you get what you pay for, but if you can afford a little more i would recommend you to choose another airbnb, and here’s why: Poor Ventilation Ruined Our Stay** Our stay at this Airbnb was unfortunately marred by poor ventilation throughout the property. Despite the listing's claims of a comfortable and airy space, we found the apartment to be stuffy and poorly ventilated. The windows were not able to open so much, and there were no fans or air conditioning available, making it hard to get fresh air into the rooms, we had to keep the door to the apartment open during the night and it felt unsafe. This was particularly problematic during the warmer parts of the day and at night, leading to an uncomfortable and restless stay. Misleading Photos - Disappointing Stay** I booked this Airbnb with high expectations based on the photos and description provided, but the reality was quite different and disappointing.",NEGATIVE
We weren’t satisfied with the apartment mainly because of the neighborhood. The apartment is located in a container village surrounded by construction work and vandalized houses. The apartment itself was clean and looked like the pictures but it was kind of dark. There is only one window and no big roomlight. The photos look way brighter than the apartment actually is. The communication with the host was good but we didn’t feel comfortable sleeping there so we decided to stay at another place instead.,NEGATIVE
"The apartment looked like the pictures, but the bed was infested with bedbugs.",NEGATIVE
"Stayed with Edlira and her two children. The AirBnB listing never mentioned children of young age, who were very loud. Would have been nice to know beforehand. The walls are paper thin so no privacy. There was a lingering oil and grease smell which was not very pleasant. Edlira was nice and gave us a couple shelves in the fridge, let us use soap, shampoo and the washer and dryer. But the apartment overall was not in the same condition as the rooms and if we had had all the information I just listed, we would not have booked.",NEGATIVE
"While it's in the center of Old Town and Charlotta was a great host and appreciated her help, I wouldn't stay on this place or location again. Cars can't drop or pick you off at the exact location so it was difficult having to walk on cobblestone with our big bags -this should be on the description. The place gets really noisy in the early mornings and during the day but you won't hear it during the night. There is basically no ventilation as there's only one extremely tiny window but the worse part was the shower. It is so tiny and not well made that it leaves the entire bathroom flooded and you have to clean after you shower which is something I don't wanna do when I'm traveling. I hope they can find a way to fix to avoid the bathroom from flooding that much for future guests.",NEGATIVE
Apartment was spaceful and nice. The big problem was apartment straight down our apartment and very thin walls. The people was partying and making big noise hole weekend. I said them about that twice but they didnt care.,NEGATIVE
I had place booked for 9 days. Baby woke up and cried for food maybe less then 5 min. Neighbour came and knocked at door and complained about child crying. Not good for families. Had to cancel the place after first night and got back just 35% although problem was from the hist side. That is really not fair. If host deduct one extra day then its ok but I would say it Airbnb policy in this matter is poor as well. Airbnb should step in and be fair with the guest as well. Really dissappointed. If this property is not family friendly then host should not rent it for families simply.,NEGATIVE
"The shower was broken, there was a piece of handle missing and the shower could nor be used. When talking by phone to the host she apologised, and was Sorry about the situation. When we asked money back she refused at to pay, denying there was anything wrong. We had to send videos and photos to AirBnb and got the refund finally.",NEGATIVE
"Charming house with an excellent location; quiet street, parking space and close to the subway and a supermarket. We were a bit disappointed that the available warm water was not sufficient to fill the bubblebath (confirmed by the owner), specially because the bath was so emphasized in the house description. There were more surprisingly unpractical things for a house were people live permanently; For example no curtains in the bedroom with double bed, a nice espresso machine, but only big coffee mugs and a dining table with inconvenient legs. The location of the house is excellent to explore the centre of Stockholm by public transport and we could leave our car safely parked on the driveway. For us it was a pleasant stay for a few days.",NEGATIVE
"Apartment was in a great location for us, super close to the underground. It’s a nice cosy apartment - although the bed isn’t massively comfortably. Unfortunately the bathroom wasn’t clean when we arrived. Saman did offer to arrange for it to be cleaned the day after our arrival but I went ahead and hoovered and cleaned so I was able to shower that evening of our arrival. It’s disappointing to have to do after a long day of travelling.",NEGATIVE
"Alicia's apartment is very nice and clean, very well located. The old town it's under the building. The apartment was quite expensive, like a 5 stars hotel, but in the end the service wasn't that good. Windows are not good enough to stop the sounds from the street, during the weekend a lot of noises from the street below. During the week, a lot of garbage trucks picking up the trash with a lot of noises especially when they dump glass bottles. So don't expect to sleep that well. Before you'll get into the apartment total dark, not even a light ball to show you the way. We went with our iPhones flash lights. Something you don't expect at that kind of price. Only one little tiny bathroom, and we were just 3 people, the apartment will be able to host 6 people, even though, I really don't know how they manage to use the little bathroom. In the kitchen not even a bottle of water, no napkins. The host also told me to not use any other extra towels. Workers next door and a lot of dust.",NEGATIVE
"Basic and small but nice studio in a nice location. Wasn't cleaned well upon arrival, unfortunately.",NEGATIVE
"The actual flat was lovely. However, the dirtiness of the place brought my ratings down. I don't know if it was human or pet hair, but every time I looked there was more hair! Thank goodness there was a vacuum. There was also nothing in the fridge. Not a bottle of water, paper towels, or condiments or anything. That was very disappointing. After a long trek from the airport you would like to have a welcome bottle of water.",NEGATIVE
"Nice Apartment, however we did not have a great experience because it was quite dirty. But after we complained about the state of the apartment Andreas quickly responded and helped us out.",NEGATIVE
"The room was unfortunately much smaller than expected and definitely not convenient for four adults. There was barely enough space to open our luggage, and we had to move the table just to pull out the sofa bed, which was uncomfortable to sleep on. We were also surprised to find that we had to clear up the rubbish and linen ourselves at the end of our stay, which felt like a task we shouldn't have had to worry about. Overall, the space was cramped and didn't provide the level of comfort we were hoping for. Despite these issues, the host was very friendly and responsive, making the check-in process smooth and answering any questions we had promptly.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is not newly renovated, it has probably been done several years ago. Thresholds and timber in windows is in bad shape. The shower head could only be in the lowest position, there was a leak from the bathroom sink, the radiators did not work, the Wi-Fi never worked (and answers from host were not helpful). The apartment was smaller than the photos indicate (less than 30 m2). We had only 1 bathtowel and 1 handtowel per person and we were staying 7 days. On top of that the towels were very worn and thin. Some of the lightbulbs were missing and there were no reading lights by the bed. We were surprised to find out that there were so many airbnb apartments from our entrance (18 keyboxes). We are used to a more personal touch in our former airbnb rentals. On the bright side the apartment was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the house was mostly quiet. The view from the balcony was good.",NEGATIVE
"Very bad experience and bad attention from the host. On the second day of our four day stay the lights went out in the dining room and in both bedrooms. We contacted him and although he saw the messages and we insisted, he did not answer until a few hours before we left, saying that the application was wrong and that he had not received the messages. On top of that, the whole flat was sloping, and there was a step in each doorway, so it was easy to trip. Also, in the bathroom, the sink and mirror were inside the shower tray, which was quite strange and impractical, as it filled up with water.",NEGATIVE
"Great location, however the apartment lacked any style and there was certainly no homely decor. The shower/toilet was very dark and cramped and the toilet seat was broken. The lounge suite & cushions need a good clean. The floor was gritty underfoot.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is ok, but the bathroom is so small, it has poor illumination in some parts of it. The building doesn’t count with elevators to senior people.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is accurately portrayed in the photos. As has been mentioned before it gets very stuffy, NO ventilation. I went out and purchased a tabletop fan. If you open the windows the flies come in. There is no fly swatter to kill them ,so you can have fresh air and flies or have no fresh. The toilet seat was loose aat the point of coming off of the toilet. I sent several messages about this and the only response was ""we've notified our maintenace team"". I was there 6 nights, no one ever came. The television didn't work properly . Again , the same response but no one ever came to repair it. I liked the apartment but do not recommend StayPlus as a management company.",NEGATIVE
"The aprtment was ok, it could have been a good stay but the toilet/shower was terrible. It's right there in the picture that the shower is small, but the reality of how small it is is surprising to say the least. The shower curtain that pulls across the door is so close that it clings to you, which is icky. The worst thing though was the smell, it smells of sewer and fungus, especially after showering, it's a choice whether to keep the door closed to shut in the smell vs opening the the door and window to air the place out and just take the smell for a while (it lessens but never goes away completely). The mail I got for checkout pointed out that they would not try to get any forgotten items back to me, like thanks, great service! The whole stairwell was dotted with keyboxes, so it seems like a bit of an airbnb factory, which might explain why they never answered directly on any of my messages but just sent pushy slightly rude canned answers.",NEGATIVE
"The location was great, and the big TV was a nice touch. Elias was friendly and accommodating, though he does have a lot of rules to remember. However, I wouldn’t stay here again because of the tiny, uncomfortable bathroom. The shower is so cramped that you’re practically on top of the toilet and sink, making it so uncomfortable that I had to ask a local friend to use their shower.",NEGATIVE
"Smaller than expected, but the location weights up for the price. However, the check in and out was not flexible, and you are charged a fee if you don’t take off bedsheets and take out the trash, something I believe should be included in the cleaning fee.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment layout is quite strange, with only one bathroom/toilet upstairs. Every morning we were woken up by the garbage truck passing right under the apartment windows. Problems with the hot water, which is not hot.",NEGATIVE
"We came 1 day late after accidentally booking the wrong dates. When we arrive They said through the phone speaker when we arrive that they cancelled us and booked in another guest to take our spot which was not communicated or we didn't get any notification what so ever !!! We just lost $600 plus they wanted to send out a cancellation fee on top of this... The lady on the phone was very rude and not very caring From the bottom of our heart, do not support their business. thanks 🙏 nick",NEGATIVE
"The accommodation itself is great but don't expect any level of communication or hospitality from the host. They will not meet you in person to check-in which is fine but they also do not respond to any messages what so ever. When I got to the property I pressed the bell numerous times with no response until I was forced to call a number on the door. Now am not sure if their usual guests don't get charged roaming fees but I certainly did and you will too. When I got through to someone, they were rude, unwelcoming and gave the vibe that I was unwanted despite having made the booking 2/3 months in advance. The person on the phone rudely checked me in via a ring door bell camera which doesn't screem creepy at all. At least the ""hotel"" itself is nice and clean. However there are cameras that followed you everywhere and I wouldn't have been surprised if they had hidden cameras in the bathroom. Staying here would make a great Black Mirror episode titled ""Humanity Not Included"".",NEGATIVE
"A perfect location right in the old town, in walking distance of everywhere. It was spotlessly clean, clutter free and lovely decorated. There were a few things that were a bit disappointing though: - When we arrived we couldn't get in. Despite ringing the doorbell (with a ring camera) many times there was no answer, and the couple that were waiting with us couldn't get through on the phone either. Someone let us in that was staying there finally but they were slow at responding on the inside bell as well (there's no one physically there to check you in, it's all digital) - There is only 1 window in the whole apartment, in the living room, so it can get quite stuffy and dark - The apartment is so much smaller than the pictures make it look Overall: a beautiful location, perfect size for a couple, clean, comfortable, just not great communication when I came to check in and the pictures didn't show the true size",NEGATIVE
We were given the wrong apartment. Way smaller and older than in the pictures . Couldn’t even fit all 4 of us. Thankfully we were given back 50%.,NEGATIVE
"Great location and apartment! However… Maintenance came to fix the kitchen faucet at 10 AM which was apparently requested the day before we checked in. He was very pushy about coming in so I allowed it, but after checking the faucet he said there was no issue. I messaged the host about this and they did not respond. The unit is also not what is advertised. It is considerably smaller, and there is no window in the bedroom. The bed is very oddly actually 2 single beds pushed together to make 1. This can kind of be seen in the photos, but it is misleading as it appears to be just 2 duvets. Not sure what the idea behind this concept is but it is odd and uncomfortable as you often fall between the mattresses. We also had requested early check in as there seemed to be no booking the night before when looking at the calendar to change dates. The host said no which is acceptable, there just wasn’t much communication about it so it was an additive which would have otherwise gone unnoticed.",NEGATIVE
"This place was clean and in a great location! We knew there would be a lot of stairs and there were and it was rough, taking luggage up and down. But really my biggest issue was that they were not responsive to any of my messages. The instructions for Wi-Fi on the Airbnb listing showed one way to get on with an incorrect password and when I messaged them, they never messaged back. Later on, I happened to see different instructions on a plastic placard sitting in front of the tissue box. It gave a different password and that one worked. Finally, there were only two tissues in the tissue box and no paper towels in the kitchen and no extras anywhere in the space. Overall, those were small issues. We ended up having a wonderful time!",NEGATIVE
"Room and location was nice, but cleaning was not great. Left overs in fridge from guest before, used napkins under couch, hair in shower and sewage drain in shower was 90% clogged. Also no toilet paper, so we had to and buy some. Also, cleaning is supposed to come every 3 days, we stayed 4 days and no cleaner. If it was better cleaned, I would have stayed there again.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment was nicely decorated and very well located, which we appreciated. However, my family and I would not stay there again due to some significant issues. The interior felt uncomfortably cold, and it seemed that the heating system was not functioning properly. We found ourselves needing to wear two layers of clothing indoors to stay warm, except in the bathroom, where the temperature was set at 24°C. Although someone did deliver a small heater after a couple of days, it only offered a temporary fix and did not fully resolve the problem. While it did help make the bedroom slightly more comfortable for our 3-month-old baby, it was not enough to overcome the overall chill of the space. Additionally, we had to contact Lukas to figure out how to make the dishwasher work (it felt like nobody had stayed in that apartment in a long time). Finally, keep in mind that this is an old building with a tiny elevador, so if you have a stroller, you have to disassemble it to make it fit inside",NEGATIVE
"Sofa bed was really bad and uncomfortable. Kitchen area not in good shape: 1 cupboard door broken, window blinder in kitchen broken, kitchen fan extractor not working. Other blinders in poor condition letting a lot of light in (in summer in Sweden sun raises at 3am).",NEGATIVE
"This little apartment is in a great location in the heart of Gamla Stan and really easy to get to the rest of Stockholm. Was a bit disappointed that the sofa bed wasn't made when we arrived, we had to put the sheets on the bed ourselves etc. You can hear the neighbours through the partition wall. The pictures of the bathroom don't reflect how small it really is, and it also doesn't have a proper shower - there is no fixed shower head, so you have to hold a small hose above yourself for the whole shower, and you cannot use the sink independently of turning the shower on. Despite these minor things, overall it was very clean, the check in/out process was easy, Olof's communication was very good and the location made it a great place to stay for a short time.",NEGATIVE
"I would not recommend staying here. Trash left behind, mysterious stains on the linens that were unmade when we arrived, sink that leaked, dirty and sparse walls. Worst part was the styrofoam wall with a blanket over it that separated us from the neighbors. Good location, but horrible apartment. We ended up leaving early it was so bad.",NEGATIVE
poor wifi poor shower poor explanation noisy scare,NEGATIVE
"The newly renovated room has a strong smell of formaldehyde. The upstairs is a confined space with two beds. Due to the smell of formaldehyde, it is actually uninhabitable. I was given the wrong floor and room name when I checked in, and the wireless network signal was not very good. When checking out, we were asked to take all the trash away. We didn't read the rules clearly and left trash in the room. The host complained that we didn't respect her rules. And the landlord requested that we check out on time, not even a minute longer. If we check out at 10 o'clock, the cleaners will come at 10:03. All in all, the experience is not very good, but the location is really great, but the smell of formaldehyde is really strong, and I have to open the window to sleep at night. All in all, if the price is similar, don't choose this place.",NEGATIVE
"Super hot, yet impossible to sleep with windows open because of the extremely loud noices from busy party street below; my family slept about 3 hours… Do NOT pick this apartment. Also very impersonal with zero decorations such as paintings etc. Looks like a hospital room.",NEGATIVE
The check in and out times were really tough to work with given traveling times.,NEGATIVE
"The apartment is in an amazing location! The area was very walkable and central to the train. Maria was difficult to communicate with. The responses all seemed like they were copied and pasted and sometimes did not address my questions. The check out instructions were not given in the initial directions and were not given until we left the Airbnb. The temperature was also very very hot. The AC does not work. We opened the windows the whole time and we still could not cool off the lofted room. The lofted room is also not eldar friendly. It is a very steep staircase, more like a ladder. You can not come close to standing up in the loft either. Overall, this place is great for the location and price, but I would not recommend it for anything other than that.",NEGATIVE
"Not recommended. Location is good. However the check-in instruction is not explicitly clear though its contents look long. Communication after check-in with the host is a disaster. We, 4 persons stayed for 5 nights. Shampoo n bathing gel were not provided as described on airbnb platform. Shampoo came upon our request on the 1st day and bathing gel was promised to come the 2nd day. However our requests sent everyday after then were left on read. Seems both Maria and Stephen dissappeared from then on. Messages from the host resumed only after we checked out the last day with lots of reasons/explanations and eventually Stephen attributed to misunderstandings caused by the inappropriate translation from airbnb platform. It is a pity...",NEGATIVE
"Weather was cold and heating wasn’t adequate, heating radiators was on very low and one of the radiators wasn’t working. Hot water in the shower was set on 38c which wasn’t hot enough if you want to have a hot shower. There was no light or power points in the bathroom so we had a shower in total darkness, there is no window in the bathroom. We stayed 4 nights, I have notified the host on the first day however nothing was done. Shower curtain fell down, rod wasn’t fixed on the wall. This apartment is out in the suburbs, not in or around the activity centres. Not an ideal location if you’re visiting the city for few days.",NEGATIVE
"The check-in was not possible after 10 PM. We paid extra money to put the key out of the building so we can open the door. (consider this matter in your booking) And, the locker pin for putting the key back for checking out, was wrong and made me bothered. all in all, nice and quiet place.",NEGATIVE
Bathroom not easy.,NEGATIVE
"The location is great and the apartment is spacious however there were a few issues. No blackout curtains - was very hard to sleep in, the cupboard in the toilet was broken so we couldn’t shut it which was annoying and when I arrived the beds were not made. I had to do this which I thought was pretty ordinary. I did complain and Lucas was prepared to refund the cleaning fee. I appreciated this but for value for money I think it’s overpriced.",NEGATIVE
"Location was great, near a lot of restaurants and beautiful neighbourhood. Elias was easy to reach and all information about check-in and checkout were given. The place is decently clean. I would unfortunately not recommend and this is the first time I don't recommend a place on Airbnb. I visited Stockholm in February and the flat was quite cold. I got a cold afterwards. I was told that there was central heating but obviously there was a problem since it was so cold in the flat. I found the process of booking a bit too complicated, I had to give my personal social media info, I never had to it before. I can understand that the owner of the place can be apprehensive about renting it to just anyone but yeah. The place itself is okay, not amazing. This bureaucracy to book and the place itself don't match. Also, not worth the price in my opinion. I paid 218€ for 4 nights (Thursday to Monday). I wish I had just rent a nice warm room in someone else flat. Keep in mind there is no internet",NEGATIVE
"The location of the apartment is unbeatable, right in the centre, everything is close and walkable, but in a quiet and calm neighbourhood. The amenities could be improved, there is no WiFi in the apartment and we didn’t have reception unfortunately, so it was quite inconvenient.The handle of the cabinet is broken, a section in the fridge was secured with a masking tape, so overall a bit of in need of repair. The apartment is in the cellar, so there’s always some noise you can hear, and as there’s no shades/curtains, we had to cover the windows with kitchen towels. The apartment is definitely smaller in real life than photos suggest. We stayed for 5 nights, and it was pretty uncomfortable for this length of time, not functional, you have no space to do anything once the bed is open, there is no surface to put things on either in the room or in the bathroom. I can imagine, it must be fine for 1-2 nights. Overall, great location for the price, suitable and recommended for shorter visit",NEGATIVE
Please note this stay does not have WiFi and while it is made certain under amenities it’s 2024 and that should be standard! Very small space and out through a courtyard and downstairs in a sketchy hallway. Underground apartment.,NEGATIVE
"This is a small basement storage turned into a room. No internet, no curtains on the windows (so much light in the night), very small space with low ceiling, next to the washing room (sound is relatively high). For me, the biggest negative was that they sent me an extra agreement to sign just the night before check-in. And said if I didn't sign it, they wouldn't let me check in. This is such a poor work ethic. If you require such a thing, you shouldn't do it very last night. You have to inform customers in advance so they can freely choose if they still want to work with you. The place was very cold the first night. The kettle they had was terrible. Doesn't look hygienic at all. If I knew the condition of it I'd definitely pay a bit more to stay somewhere else.",NEGATIVE
Very tiny room in storage space. It's costly for the room we spend. It was my mistake not to look full details because of hurry in my booking. Otherwise room is tidy and kitchen utensils are also available.,NEGATIVE
"We expected 2 rooms for three of us. 2 beds and sofa bed in small room very inadequate. Two electric sockets not working. No instructions on setting up sofa or using hob. Confirmation from Airbnb said we could book in from 8 am. On arrival in Stockholm, told we had to wait till 3 pm which was extremely inconvenient. Locked door when we did arrive. But please pass on to chef - very good breakfast.",NEGATIVE
"Overall the stay was not bad but there are quite a few things that were not good: 1. The name on the door was not matching the name they said we should look for on the check in message, that was extremely confusing and made us (tired and heavily packed) loose a lot of time trying to find where we should go. 2. The apartment was not equipped with all the basic things necessary for a stay. No hair dryer, only one towel per person, only one kitchen towel and only one toilet paper (we stayed for 7 nights, that’s definitely not enough!!!!) 3. The kitchen supplies were extremely bad. Salt, pepper and a bit of oil are not enough ingredients for someone staying for a long period, things like tea bags, napkins or spices should be available. 4. Even with the heaters on it was very cold inside. As I said before the apartment is nice, perfect for 2 people, but there are things missing and it is quite far from the city center, be prepared to spend at least 7 more euros with train every day.",NEGATIVE
"The first thing I noticed when I entered the apartment was that it smelled like old cigarette smoke, like someone regularly smokes inside and the smoke had permeated the walls. When I opened the utensil drawer it was clear the vegetable peeler had been used and not cleaned. For this reason we washed every dish before using it because we were uncertain if anything was properly cleaned. The listing notes that washer/dryer are available which was one of the reasons I booked this apartment. The washer and dryer are used by the whole building and you must sign up for a time slot. Additionally, detergent was not provided so we would have had to buy our own detergent just to be used once. I ended up just not washing my clothes. The neighborhood as a whole was quiet and easily accessible, but we were concerned by the swastica painted on the neighbor’s door. Finally, the listing indicated the apartment was on the second floor. It is on the third and there is no elevator.",NEGATIVE
Real shame of accommodation. No check in details. The phone number is not correct. Terrible experience.,NEGATIVE
"DO NOT book this place. The hotel was overbooked and when we arrived, our room was already occupied by other people and the staff did nothing to correct the matter. No apologies, either. There were 3 other groups, who didn't get their room. Even beforehand, the customer service was crappy and during this situation, it was just ridiculously terrible. I repeat: do not book this place.",NEGATIVE
"The room is very nice, but very small. Really much smaller than expected. No cushions on the terrace. Parking not at the „house“ as we expected. Also TV didn’t work (although host was very responsive and gave instructions), we still couldn’t watch EC soccer match (of course we didn’t came for that, but still…). With tennis courts across it’s also not really in the middle of nature. I am really sorry for that review, but we were really disappointed as we expected much more for we paid.",NEGATIVE
"Nice apartment. Convenient location for local bus travel. But it has very tiny shower chamber which is difficult to go in. Kitchen utensils are inadequate. Need to keep bigger cooking bowls and panes. There is no lift to go up to second floor and stairs are very inconvenient with luggage and for senior citizens. Check in is complex with three codes , lock for the wooden rack , lock box and then code for building access. No washing machine here. Very basic place.",NEGATIVE
Far from the city and not worth the price,NEGATIVE
"Modern and new design, clean and tidy. Around 10-15mins walk to metro station and supermarkets. Some issues: - No instruction for how to use the houseware, and the host seems not familiar with the facilities. Struggled to use the washing machine at the beginning, and it finally worked only when you switched on another device. It’s a bit annoying. - One of the cooking pots is kind of burnt and not good for use, the host replaced with the new one on the 3rd day after check in. - Be mindful that there is no microwave oven - The spring mattress is not comfortable for us, the other will be disturbed even if one slightly roll the body. Also the bed squeaked quite loud, couldn’t sleep well.",NEGATIVE
"I regret booking this Airbnb for several reasons. Host communication was minimal; Andreas gave only basic directions and didn’t address specific questions, making navigating an unfamiliar city difficult, ignored me 90% of the time. The 15% cleaning fee felt excessive since I had to get things from the machine, take out trash, and strip linens myself. The apartment was uncomfortably cold, with no heating adjustments. Photos in the listing didn’t match the actual space, which was disappointing. The property’s location is inconvenient, over an hour from Arlanda Airport with costly, complex transport options. Basic amenities like tea, coffee, or sufficient toilet paper weren’t provided, and groceries required a long walk across a highway. The bedding was uncomfortable, with small blankets and inadequate pillows causing neck pain, no sheets nor linen.Automated messages with strict rules felt excessive, and the check-in process involved standing in freezing conditions to unlock multiple lock",NEGATIVE
It was ok. But pictures have shown a window in the bedroom and the shower looked different on pictures. I didn’t have a window in my room in the end and tbh I felt not comfortable in the apartment.,NEGATIVE
"Good price. Good location. Nice host. More-or-less exactly what I wanted. As the advert made clear, it is very basic. However, there were a few niggles that I think could be improved. The curtains to the bedroom were not very dark, so I found it a bit annoying when the bedroom would light up every time someone turned the light on in the kitchen. The shared bathroom was very dated (eg the shower door kept falling off). Finally, the advert made clear that the bedroom did not have a window, but there wasn't really a window in the communal space either. Given the price, I can't really have too many complaints about these things. It was overall a great find and I would absolutely stay there again given the same budget.",NEGATIVE
"We spent 2 weeks at this flat. The place was very clean, and the self-check-in was seamless, thanks to clear instructions. Andreas was nice and polite. Unfortunately, we encountered an issue with the WiFi, which didn't work for a week. Since we both work remotely, this caused a lot of inconvenience and we had to spend additional money on mobile internet. The communication also wasn't the best as Andreas isn't the landlord of the flat and he only transmits messages to the landlord. Therefore communication regarding the Internet problem was very slow and mostly had no result. We don't know what the problem was and we understand that it could be hard to solve and took time. However, it seemed that no action was taken, as I had to ask about it every day, feeling like no one cared. Also, one day before arrival we were informed that there was a noise control device in the apartment. It was no problem for us but it would be nice to know about all the rules and requirements before booking.",NEGATIVE
"The WiFi should be fixed. Initially it was included in the booking, and after a day we arrived, the WiFi could not be connected and we were told to be “WiFi is not included”. However, we did receive the WiFi password prior we arrived. After I told Andreas, he said he could provide check-up for the WiFi. It was a bit inconvenient to us, so we refused. Therefore, the instability of the WiFi should be taken into consideration. The decoration of the house was not as much as in the photos as provided. All kitchen appliances were installed. If microwave oven was installed would be delighted. The transportation is quite convenient to the Stockholm C and 15 mins to the metro station. The supermarkets are near too, and the one nearby provide post service too. It is a quiet neighborhood. If provided with more rubbish bags would be better. Also, it more shelves installed in the bathroom would be better as there is just a sink for putting the stuff. Overall, it is a great place and comfortable",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is clean and well renovated, with standard furniture. However, it is clearly an industrialized building with many similar units. Communication is only with a bot, and the excessive request for identity information is unjustified. Additionally, I find it unreasonable to have to accept rules through another platform when everything is already validated through Airbnb. The apartment was very noisy: you can hear neighbors walking in the stairs as if they were inside the apartment. The ventilation system (VMC) is noisy and cannot be turned off. The electric cooktop was dirty, and the dishwasher hadn’t been emptied. Although everything was well explained for the arrival, these inconveniences tarnished the experience.",NEGATIVE
"My review of Ted place is solely based on the fact. That it isn’t 100% clear that you have just one floor. I feel like I reserved the airbnb and then some of the title description had changed. Airbnb should definitely flag the description as it can be MISLEADING. And I asked him to cancel my reservation twice and he wouldn’t do it. Way before the date I had booked it, I asked him to cancel and he would not, also I asked him to cancel the night before I arrived as I had issues at the Stockholm airport which they lost my luggage and I couldn’t make it to the Airbnb, still he would not cancel and issue me a refund. I tried reaching out to Airbnb but they said that Ted the host does not want to issue you any type of refund. I ended NOT going to Ted’s place at all, because I didn’t feel safe or comfortable to be in a house and a room with three other people living there and I am not familiar with the country or the culture and he still charged me for the two days that I had reserved.",NEGATIVE
"Plus: the apartment is large and spacious Cons : A million rules for occupancy, we pay for cleaning, but we have to collect garbage ourselves, wash dishes, fold bed linen and towels, before check-in we asked for a link to social networks (this is the first time I’ve met this . The biggest minus is very very VERY cold It is impossible to stay in the apartment, drafts, heating does not help . We wore jackets at home",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is in a lovely location with a peaceful atmosphere and a beautiful view, within walking distance to the metro, which was very convenient. However, the property did not match the photos online. It lacked the decoration and cosiness depicted, the bedsheets were just a duvet and cushions, and the house appeared older in person. The heating system was problematic, as some units could not be switched off, making it uncomfortably warm. Despite paying a cleaning fee, we were expected to remove bedsheets and take out the trash, which was surprising. On a positive note, the apartment was clean, and we had a nice time with the basic amenities provided. An honest representation of the property and clarity about the cleaning expectations would improve the overall experience.",NEGATIVE
"We didn’t have a great experience at Fredrik’s place. Firstly, there were no toilet rolls and the toilet door was not working. Then the stove was not getting unlocked as someone put a child lock. Though Fredrik tried to help us and was quite responsive but we had to plan our dinner out till that was resolved. So all in all, an average experience.",NEGATIVE
Unfortunately this was not the best experience. Communication right after booking was a long list of rules that might have been appropriate for younger/newer Airbnb guests but seemed very unwelcoming for experienced guests with many positive reviews. I was uncomfortable with being asked to provide additional personal information like social media accounts and personal email etc. I was told my personal email was needed to share check-in information but then was sent this info through the Airbnb app so not sure why I was forced to provide it. The apartment itself is ok. Limited kitchen items and in general in need of some updating /refurbishment. The walls are thin and noise from neighbors can be distracting. Missing personal/thoughtful touches and a house manual with details on the apartment and neighborhood would have been useful. Some positives were the nice selection of restaurants nearby and close to transportation.,NEGATIVE
"What a terrific location! The neighborhood is lively with lots of public transportation options. And the apartment was quiet, clean and felt spacious. However, because the apartment seems to be professionally managed, the overall vibe didn’t feel cozy and the amenities were quite basic: the kitchen is not well equipped, for instance.",NEGATIVE
"We stayed for a week at this airbnb. It was very clean, in a wonderful area, and it was beautiful, but there were a few problems with it. For instance the tub leaks badly and it’s hard to shower because of it. We reported the issue and he said he would send someone in to clean the drain to prevent the flooding and that never happened. We only got 3 bath towels for the whole week and a bunch of small hand towels, which we had to use to soak up the flood in the bathroom and when we asked about more he said we would have to buy them if we wanted more, which felt unbelievable because I paid a lot of money to stay here. I would also have liked a microwave. He was very kind and helpful, and overall it was a good place to spend our week!",NEGATIVE
"There is a lot to like. Views of the river are beautiful and there is a lot of space in the living room to spread out. Getting to the main touristy areas or a grocery store/restaurant is an easy Uber. Main issue was the lack of necessities. Washer but no laundry detergent. Dishwasher but no dish soap or sponge. No paper towels. Only one roll of toilet paper per bathroom. The other main issue was the top stairs are unsafe for small children. Wish the listing had said unsuitable for small children. With added necessities, the place is great for families with older kids or a group of adults.",NEGATIVE
"Large, light & airy flat, 3 double bedrooms with comfy beds. Great location (quiet island, sea swimming, Coop shop, pizza & Thai takeaway & restaurants, and bus to city centre all within 7 mins walk). The flat was not completely clean on arrival (fingerprints all over fridge & freezer, and sink plughole. under couches and the low wall between stairs & dining table were very dirty). Also couple of lights didn't work, including main lounge light which we reported immediately but it was never fixed (looking at earlier reviews, this problem had been flagged by previous guests) so lounge was dark every evenings (bar a small side light) which wasn't great. Overall, big flat, in great location, let down by poor cleaning & maintenance.",NEGATIVE
"Nice apartment, got noise complaints for usual living noices, which resulted in us having to be tediously quiet, thus reducing the living quality.",NEGATIVE
"The location was ideal, and the apartment itself had a lot of charm. However, there were a few aspects that dampened our experience. While we appreciated the original Airbnb model of the place, it was filled with the owner's belongings, leaving little space for ours. Additionally, the lack of adequate heating made it less than ideal for colder weather. The cleanliness of the bedroom and bathroom was good, but the bathroom lacked a working light, doors don’t close properly. In the kitchen, while it appeared clean, the presence of a half full trash can and spoiled food in the refrigerator emitted an unpleasant odor. A major issue personally for me was the lack of privacy in the bedroom due to uncovered windows at night.",NEGATIVE
"I don't recommend this accommodation! The apartment is Emma's home, we arrived and she left the apartment, leaving everything messy, with her clothes and shoes all around the house, the drawers of the closets with underwear. The curtains in the room didn't close, and the bedroom window faces the courtyard of the building where everyone who is passing by can see inside the room (the curtain control was out of battery). Another negative point was the fridge full of food and Emma's own things. Emma is a great person, but unfortunately the apartment does not match the photos and does not correspond to the price that is currently being charged. We had to leave the apartment and look for another accommodation. I have photos to prove it! So much so that Airbnb refunded me",NEGATIVE
"The comunication was very bad. The host didn’t sent us any information about check in and noone answeared the phone calls either at the beginning. After all the apartment was very nice, clean and placed in very good location.",NEGATIVE
"If you want to get stuck inside an apartment. This place is perfect for you. But in reality. This place has got a fancy lock. And requires waiting for it. Just to leave the apartment. Then Once you enter the code to get in, you have to wait for it again. The instructions were very confusing. Then I found out it has a by pass turn knob to unlock it after talking to the host.",NEGATIVE
"If location is what you are after, this is perfect although very noisy which is expected in touristy area. It does lack tools and flatware for the 7 people in our group. Someone always had to eat with a bamboo fork. There are enough beds but not particularly comfortable. On the whole there was some issues but would stay there again because of location.",NEGATIVE
"Overall, a good stay. The check-in process was the worst part, but after that it was smooth sailing. The host tried so hard to be clear about the check-in process that it became overly complicated with multiple messages and inconsistencies between them, and a lack of response to my questions trying to clarify different points didn’t help. A simple message with the building code and room code would have sufficed. Also, the 4pm check-in is later than any I’ve ever had, and absolutely no wiggle room from the host. It stinks because during a good portion of the year in Stockholm it’s already dark by then and stores are near closing. After the check-in annoyances, everything was fantastic. The place was clean and beautiful and it couldn’t have been in a better location. Great shopping and restaurants nearby, and quiet neighbors. Would stay here again, especially now that I’ve worked out that the apparently complex check-in and locking system is not so bad at all.",NEGATIVE
"Good location. Communicative host. We had some problems with wifi connection so we ended up using someone else's free wifi with the week signal. Shower towels had a bad smell. Kinda noisy from the outside, not the best noise-isolation. Windows are not opening, could be a big pain-point when it's hot outside. Also no AC.",NEGATIVE
"The room I was given in the building had a problem with the lock. It was unable to lock from the outside which was very worrying whenever I had to leave. The landlord did not communicate timely and could not understand what I was saying. It took them 4 days to come fix the lock after I reported to Airbnb support. Checkout instructions were given a few hours before checkout, which was way too late because I had already left. The location is perfect, noisy, but that's expected. The bedroom door was unable to close either.",NEGATIVE
Great but shower was broken the entire time,NEGATIVE
"Very basic apartment, bought by someone just to rent it: IKEA-only interior and curtains not even shortened to fit. Outdated bathroom (the pictures don't show everything) with defects. Basic kitchen utensils. And only four cups, four plates, four spoons, four knives and so on and so on. Never mind the dishwasher, with the four of us in the apartment we had to do the dishes after every single use. The sofa bed is too small for two, even for the kids. And the (dinner) table and placement is way too small for four people. While making the reservation we were asked to provide our email addresses and social media profiles (url / links). Most messages the host sent us were automated. We could have known better but checked too late; this host has over 80 (!) apartments on Airbnb. Probably one of the reasons housing is getting more and more expensive in Stockholm. Other: - quick communication - metro stop (Bagarmossen) withing walking distance - so is supermarket and basic other - clean",NEGATIVE
"In general everything went well. Some comments: -the communication was really slow, the hosts do not answer messages for several days, I had to insist to get basic information for check-in (as we where a group it was specially complicated as some arrived earlier than me doing the reservation). -Mattresses are of really bad quality and old. For this price, they should provide better mattresses -IMPORTANT: the access to one of the room is through another room. This is not communicated in the rental page. Be carefull when travelling in a group if you need privacy",NEGATIVE
"I really wanted to rate this stay better, but there were so many issues with both the host and the property. The co-host, Stefan, responded to questions with copy/paste replies that didn't really address the questions we asked. On day 4 of our 10-day stay, I reported a beeping fire alarm and requested help, Stefan asked me to take it down and he'd be over the next day to fix it. There was no screwdriver or replacement batteries in the unit; he never showed to service it during our stay and didn't respond to follow on messages. They sent check out instructions two hours before check-out - but we had already left for the airport several hours prior. The main shower had black and orange mold, the secondary shower is a converted coat closet at the entry. The kitchen faucet had a leak ""fixed"" with scotch tape. Furniture was stained, a lamp with a stained lampshade was oddly on the floor, without an end table. The location was amazing - but the condition of the unit was not worth the price.",NEGATIVE
"Unfortunately, our experience with this host was disappointing. Despite our agreement, the keys were not left at the designated pick-up point, and the host was unresponsive to our phone calls. As a result, we were left stranded and had to search for a hotel room at midnight during the busy Christmas holiday season. Based on this experience, I cannot recommend this host.",NEGATIVE
The price of this place was quadruple the usual price due to Taylor Swift concert so it’s understandable. Getting in here was difficult; picking up the key at a best western hotel that was quite a distance from the apartment was inconvenient; it required 2 separate Uber rides because of the distance. Also the key was not waiting for us at the hotel so we had to wait about an hour in the lobby of the hotel. There is a lot of very noisy construction surrounding this place; excessive daytime noise was a problem. On the plus side there are decent restaurants within 10-15 walk. Nearest metro is at least a 15 minute walk. I would not stay here again but it was the best we could do because everything was booked up for the concert. Apartment was clean and the main bed was comfortable except for the pillows and sheets ( lumpy and scratchy) . Nice balcony to sit outside.,NEGATIVE
"The worst trip ever, bad located and so much smell of ciggares inside apartmen, the agent is impossible to reach",NEGATIVE
"The location was excellent. Andreas communicated really well with updates up until our stay. However, after completing the form reference sleeping arrangements, and stipulating that two beds would be required; the separate sofa bed was not made up, nor were there the required sheets for this. This was brought up to the host on messages with no response. The apartment is exactly as described and clean, however the dishwasher was not emptied and the oven tray was dirty. The WiFi did not work for us at all. On the advert for this property it’s states a check out of 1100hrs, however the separate house rules state 1000hrs. When I sought clarification and explained that we would like to stay until 1100 I was told we had to leave by 1000 due to cleaners arriving etc. On the day of departure, I had a message offering a late checkout - we declined. I wouldn’t stay here again.",NEGATIVE
"Our experience was good, but not great. There were many small details that just annoyed us, like not great maintenance of the place or imperfections in the check-in process. In the end we had a good time, but it did not deliver on expectations. Andreas did a good job keeping communication flowing, but it was not enough to justify a great rating.",NEGATIVE
"The location can't be beat and Olof's place was clean but it is very small, something the pictures don't show (e.g. your knees hit the wall when sitting on the toilet). The bathroom and kitchen are prohibitively small, we didn't even bother trying to prepare food during our stay. Overall. the apartment clearly lacks in attention to detail. The lighting is horrible and one (of only two) lamps didn't even work (prior reviewers also complained about this and it still wasn't addressed). He has candles but doesn't even offer a means to light them. The space wasn't very inviting, which made us prefer not to be there much, other than to sleep. It just lacks in asthetics, and appears to be a half hearted effort that is for nothing more than to turn a profit with minimal effort. For this price you can certainly find better options, I won't ever stay here again and I can't recommend it to anyone.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment did smell a bit and wasn’t so clean.. and we paid 700kr for cleaning but yet we needed to fix all the sheets and the towels. Also take out the trash and on top of that you have to wash the dishes.. I’m wondering what they are cleaning if the floor is still dirty and some table surfaces? For those with a car, it’s hard to find a parking lot so keep that in mind that it can take some time.",NEGATIVE
Walking distance to everything you need to get to but not as nice as pictured.,NEGATIVE
"The space is very compact, which became challenging when the pull-out bed was in use, blocking access to the bedroom. The bedroom has no doors or curtains, offering no privacy. Storage was a significant issue. The apartment was cluttered with dirty buckets, vacuums, cleaning supplies, and excess linens, leaving no room for our clothing or suitcases. While the decorations were nice, there were too many, reducing usable space. The listing pictures made the space look more organized and larger than it is. Curtains shown in photos were not present, which was disappointing. The kitchen was generally good, but the oven seal was broken, making it unusable. The bathroom had hot water and good pressure but limited storage for toiletries. We also noticed mold around the sink and the small window. On the bright side, the host was very responsive and promptly provided a hairdryer and iron upon request.",NEGATIVE
Really not appropriate if you want to sleep in two different beds. We asked the owner if he could at least block the light from the window or put back the door supposed to separate the two rooms. He never answered. Bad WiFi : unsteady. Almost no natural light as it is located in a basement. Really expensive for what it is. Disappointed,NEGATIVE
"The place and the price are not match. It is very expenssive according to the the qualification of the house. The house not worthy to be such price. First it is in the badement, not enough beds for four peaple. The host said that the house can hold max 4 guests but it is not. Even the bedroom in not confortable to sleep in cos of heavy atmosphere, we got lack of breathing, we could not sleep. There is one small window there, the window is located in the same level with the ground. If you open it it gets to cold, if close it, you got shortage of breathing. I was like wake up at 04:00 or at 05:00 to open the window to get fresh air for about 10min then close it and sleep again. That was a bad experience. I have used airbnb many times. This was very unexpected for me place according to the picture. I could say many things but this was the most important to say about this place.",NEGATIVE
On the first floor on a very noisy street. No fan or air conditioning and impossible to have windows open due to noise.,NEGATIVE
"The place was nice looking and clean and in a central spot but unfortunately the problem with no heating left a less good impression. Clara was kind and brought a small portable radiator but there was no bathroom heating and the rest of the rooms were cold except for were the heater was kept. The places was also slightly oddly set up, tv on the floor (not plugged in) and lamps with no where to plug them in.",NEGATIVE
"The reason why I gave 3 stars is because we were rushed out of the place before check out time. the application clearly stated check out was at 11 am. The cleaning lady arrived at 10 and asked us to leave. I asked her to give us some time to pack. We were at it when I got a message from Stephan in a tone I did not appreciate asking me to ""respect the check out time"" (which I did) and demanding to leave as they needed the room -now- At the moment of receiving that message it was still 30 minutes before check out",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is well kept and clean but the coldness of the contact, the rigidity and the lack of any personal contact beyond the routine -like messages made us feel we were dealing with a robot. Once we asked to leave the one piece luggage outside the door just for an hour to allow going for breakfast without getting wet under the rain we did not even receive a line. Where is the sense of community so much underlined by airbnb? Meer business seems to be the core.",NEGATIVE
Lots of noise because it's heart of Europe,NEGATIVE
"It is a beautifully decorated apartment in a central and lovely district. However we were a bit annoyed as it fell short on the sleeping arrangements: having only 2 duvets (smaller than the bed) and 2 towels out when the home is advertised for 3, and especially not having the bed made but requiring the guest to remove the sheets after the stay was clearly insufficient considering the price + cleaning fee. Also one of the pillow was clearly in a dirty state. We sent the above comments and got refunded less than 10€…",NEGATIVE
"Not a good experience with this apartment, Olof himself was a good sport about it. I would not recommend this apartment, it is located in a building that is under construction and the floor it is situated on is everything but cozy and inviting. I could not get into the building nor reach the third floor the apartment is located at. I only managed to get into the building because some other people coincidentally walked out of the building. After that I was stuck in the elevator en could only get out because there was someone there to help me. I would not recommend this place. Olof was friendly and helping when I told my situation but in the end, I did not stay in the apartment.",NEGATIVE
"Our eagerness for Olaf's discounted Södermalm retreat quickly turned to disenchantment due to severe check-in issues. Despite extensive pre-arrival dialogue, Olaf's abrupt disappearance at our critical moment of arrival, coupled with ineffective door codes, left us and other guests marooned, some without their essentials. This silence, starkly at odds with our informed arrival plans, was distressing and fundamentally unacceptable. This failure in communication starkly highlighted a significant shortfall in the Airbnb host-guest interaction paradigm. It emphasizes the necessity for hosts to maintain robust, responsive communication channels, especially during essential transition points like check-in. This breakdown in trust overshadowed our potential memorable experience, spotlighting the vital importance of reliability and promptness in the hospitality domain, crucial for shaping guest experiences and satisfaction.",NEGATIVE
"It was a functional home with basic equipment and furniture. It served my purpose very well except the kitchen that was missing pots so I couldn't really cook or boil anything. Got the first apartment where the smell from the bathroom was too strong ang got really good service to change to another apartment, but unfortunatly that bathroom smells bad too. Even if you close the bathroom door you'll feel the smell in the apartment. For living there only five days I was hoping to not have to complain or ask for support all time. You should really make some maintenance on your apartments. Other than that Olof communicated well. The location is calm close to beautiful environment.",NEGATIVE
"I rarely complain and do so with reluctance. An essential ( sine qua non ) for my stay was the advertised wi fi . From UK so this was essential as otherwise had no means to communicate etc . The Wi-Fi did not work . As a result I had to wander round Stockholm trying to find a Wi-Fi signal to notify the host and wait for replies . The response was to merely repeat the details including password , which were not working ! Totally unacceptable and ruined what was meant to a relaxing four night break . But for this I would not complain about the kettle that was not working , the window that did not shut , the uninspiring view ,the need to have three separate access codes and the dirty lift that was being used by builders . Not happy",NEGATIVE
"I liked the decoration and location of the accommodation. I didn't like that there is no washing machine and in the advertisement it said there is . I also didn't like that they asked me for a requirement to reserve my social networks and LinkedIn, a suspicious attitude on behalf of this host.",NEGATIVE
"When arriving and finding out I could not acces the airbnb, Olof told me to push up the handle while pressing the code and when this did not work he stopped reacting. After waiting for an hour I was outside with no place to sleep at 22.30 and eventhough Olof was aware of the situation he did not do anything. I would not recommend anyone staying at this place and I hope no one else will have to experience this.",NEGATIVE
"Olof's apartment is in a good area. Unfortunately some things did not work out as planned. The door code and the internet access did not work right away. Unfortunately, we also found the apartment not completely clean. Olof was always at our disposal.",NEGATIVE
"I must be honest, as I booked this place based on previous great reviews from the guests … I had the bad luck to arrive for a late check out, so the surroundings and look of the building at night wasn’t helping: It is an actual clinic (or ex elder house I’m not sure…) So elevator wasn’t functioning in the entrance I found (the address given is the name of the clinic/ not the street itself) When I managed to take the stares instead, climbed 3 floor to access to giant corridors flooded into darkness, I walk 10 nim to find my cell … opened the code door, and found an hospital room (photos were took with a fish eye camera/ real proportion of the place are tinier than expected… and the bedroom is literally giving in the entrance, as is the bathroom … decor has lived since the pictures and the bed linen are more than spartiate (not as pictures again) I did not cancel because I would have lost my initial money but I would not rent again… Sorry to be that negative 👏🏻",NEGATIVE
"Grateful for the place to stay. Left it to the last minute and only place available. Great communication from host. All coded entry so no keys. Personally I feel checkout at 10:00 hrs should be changed to 11:00 hrs or 12:00 hrs. They offer a later checkout for more money which they message you about. Bathroom isn’t the best with a constant overwhelming smell of sewage. Building work right outside will wake you up at 08:00 hrs. The window handle in sitting room was broken. Very basic kitchen. Nonetheless, hot water, working toilet and comfy bed. The sitting room is lovely though and place felt clean.",NEGATIVE
"Comunication with the host is impossible as it seems like you're talking to a robot. We had different broken screws in the windows, a mulfuncioning bathroom door and no lights in some lamps. We proceeded in reporting those issues, our complaints were recieved and in 4 days no one reached out or tried to fix the issues in person. Location is nothing special but in line with the price range.",NEGATIVE
"Despite negative reviews i still went ahead and booked as needed somewhere to stay on short notice and apartment looked decent judging from photos. As other reviews mention, there was a a strong smell of sewage coming from bathroom and dirty soiled bedding left in one storage cabinet. Apartment was also in an ex-hospital which was not made clear looking at the photos and listing. Didn't feel safe staying in the location and I checked out the same day incurring extra cost of a hotel. Airbnd support were really helpful in resolving the matter.",NEGATIVE
"We had a few problems with Olofs Place… for example the elevator didn’t work, there was a weird smell in the staircase, the shower water was very hot and when we booked this stay it wasn’t listed yet that there are constructions going on from 8am to 8pm. Also you can’t open the windows all the way as there is a block installed which wasn’t very pleasant in the summer. However, considering it was one of the cheapest apartments we could find you get what you paid for. Olof himself also answered quickly. Just keep in mind that it’s not a luxurious getaway:)",NEGATIVE
"This place is tiiiiiny. If you're coming to Stockholm and only need a place to sleep - this place is it. If you're staying for a longer time and want to feel at home, pick a different spot. Bus stop was right outside which was positive. In general, as underwhelmed as I expected.",NEGATIVE
"First of all, the SMELL in the apartment was terrible. And the apartment looks quite different at photos.",NEGATIVE
"The first communication with the host was quite pleasant, however when arriving the check in time was 4pm, we arrive at 5pm and they were just starting cleaning the apartment saying that they communicated the host about it but no notice to us was sent. This cause a tremendous stress to us and my pregnant sister in law, we were all tired from our long trip and needed to rest. They finished cleaning at almost 6pm and finally could enter the place and still it was not properly cleaned. Overall they need to improve their communication and cleaning process so this won’t happen again to any future guests.",NEGATIVE
"Overall, we were satisfied. The bathroom could use some improvements, but the toilet tank definitely needs to be replaced, as it caused a lot of frustration.",NEGATIVE
"Location is close to metro station and to city center. Unfortunately, building is under construction inside and outside which we weren't informed about at all. One elevator didn't work and the remaining one was used by builders so we had to wait around 15 minutes for a space to go downstairs each time. Main doors, elevator and flat door use code to work which is annoying after couple of trips. Builders woke us up at 7 am when they start their work. Building use to be a Hospital now made into flats, which you can easily tell once you get in. It needs some improvements and once the construction stops it will be a nice place to stay.",NEGATIVE
"It felt very basic, we were woken up by someone drilling in the wall at 8 am, and then there was a lot of construction material in the hallway. Besides that, the building has a weird vibe, with a dirty elevator and poorly maintained corridor. But the apartment was clean and had all the amenities.",NEGATIVE
"Positives: - Clean - Basic but complete amenities - Good price Negatives: - The building was rather old, not very functional, and mixed with some medical practices - The location is not very close to metro stops.",NEGATIVE
"Great host but property needs work. Its an old hospital building and still feels like it, quite cold feeling and unwelcoming, hallways and lift are horrifying and need a lot of work. Property looking different to pictures when i checked in a lot of the decor was missing Bathroom needs a lot of work done, you can shower without getting the whole floor wet",NEGATIVE
"Excellent location and great value for the money. The only minor gripe we had was the repair work in the building starting at 7am every morning, but that's just unfortunate timing.",NEGATIVE
"The place was nice, but we had problems with the check in, when we arrived the sheets and the towels were dirty and on the floor, they gave us another apartment but with all the inconvenience like getting more sheets for this new apartment and the time lost, we lost money with a reservation we made. We ask for a refund but the host doesn’t respond the messages. By the way, if you want to cook in these apartments you need to bring your own oil, because they don’t even provide it.",NEGATIVE
"Close to a grocery store, bed and couch were pretty comfortable. Glad we have a kitchen and large bathroom space. Unfortunately the bathroom had a very bad smell that did not go away our entire stay. There was also a lot of construction noise that started at 6AM that we were not informed about. The building seemed to be a work in progress.",NEGATIVE
"A lot of things to say. Apartment pretty dirt and unfunctional. Freezer broken so I had to throw all my food for the 4 days. Bathroom dirt, sheets and bedstuff extra dirt.",NEGATIVE
"completely unexpected, everything is too old except the micro i write this only to Wake them up otherwise i am very positive person. To get money you have to spend money!!!!! totally not recommended on this situation",NEGATIVE
"I booked the apartment for a vacation in stockholm, arrived to the building to discover the elevator is not working, and the apartment is in the 6th floor, then found there are multiple locks for the keys, and it's hard to know which one belongs to the apartment, so spent an hour in the stairwell trying to find my way to the unit. I booked knowing there is an elevator working, due to back pain issues. Afterwards I went to the unit which looked nothing like the photos at all, contacted the host, and she told me that we have admin issues which shows photos for another apartments that they had in this ad, which didn't make any sense to me!! I contacted Airbnb, as I found the ad for the apartment which I checked in matching another ad which the host for a much cheaper apartment for the one I booked, posted by the same host (coincidence hah !!), so they gave me the option to check out, as the host gave me a different apartment, thinking I wouldn't notice, and I will just accept it.",NEGATIVE
"Bad experience PROS: - convenient location with a nice view of the river - spacious apartment - bedroom with a comfortable bed - refunded part of the money for all the problems that were created in the house and which made the stay unpleasant CONS: - very uncomfortable sofa bed - very old and dirty kitchen, very dirty and unclean utensils in the house, dirty plates and glasses, dirty bowls - a freezer full of ice that wouldn't close, kept leaking water which was wetting the entire floor - very old and dirty gas stove - vacuum cleaner with a faulty power cord - The elevator was broken for the entire period of the stay, it was a problem for my elderly parents to have to go up to the third floor on foot - absence of dark curtains for the third person sleeping in the living room",NEGATIVE
"Very spacious flat in a quiet neighborhood. Lots of natural light. Perhaps this could be attributed to me not reading carefully enough, but I was disappointed that hair conditioner and laundry detergent were not included in the amenities. It is particularly odd to me that a washing machine and dryer are available without laundry detergent provided. Also, the primary bathroom did not include a toilet paper holder. The extra half bathroom was nice, though.",NEGATIVE
"This was a stylish, spacious and clean flat in quiet surroundings. The only issue was that it was a 15-20 min train journey from central station. The location is a suburb, and does not feel like being in central Stockholm. Having said that, the train is easy and the cost is covered in a public transport day pass. Not sure if I missed the info on location, but it was disappointing not to be in the city centre with its atmosphere, and with restaurants etc close by.",NEGATIVE
"1. - Be aware, there is now WiFi in the apartments, which does not make any sense to me, host refused to elaborate and find options even I was in a desperate need of internate. 2. - Host itself is a business account, so don't expect any flexibility or a humanity. Automated conversations, multiple repeating and money-oriented approach, long response times. 3. - Provided host number is simply not exist :) 4. - Check-in instructions are confusing and needs to be revisit. Codes and pictures are messed up. 5. + Really good price and exceptional furniture! 6. + New towels were provided after a few weeks of renting. 7. - Bad quality window in a bedroom, constantly feeling a wind blow. 8. - Poor noise isolation, snoring of neighbors extremely annoying.",NEGATIVE
The apartment was clean but the toilet smelled very bad and the smell spread to the apartment at times. The location was good and central. The host did not communicate approapriately and we were asked for an extra fee to be paid in cash…,NEGATIVE
"We really enjoyed our stay at the flat. It is large, clean, and in a beautiful neighbourhood, with lots of nice amenities. We would like to stay here again. A few things meant this was not a five star stay. Finding the key box in the dark and cold was difficult as the instructions were unclear; there were some basics missing from the flat - kettle, toaster, bread knife - boiling water for our tea in a saucepan was not great; and, the lights in the bathroom did not work. These are all first world problems but with a few tweaks, this could be the most amazing luxurious stay!",NEGATIVE
"The apartment itself was good, the only problem was the kitchen stove that took for ever to heat up so we ended up giving up on cooking and went out for dinner. The building it was in wasn’t so great, the elevator felt like it was falling apart and the front door kept getting stuck. Initially had problem getting into apartment due to being given the wrong access code. Luckily the host was quite quick to reply and give us the correct one.",NEGATIVE
We had the enterance problem about lock system. Lock did not work 3 hours at night 22.30 to 01.30 am to .we wait the answer. My wife have a medicine inside but we can not get inside the room. It was bad time. The kitchen plate and some tools dirty.,NEGATIVE
"Once you are inside the flat, it is ok, clean and well decorated. There is however no fridge, and the bathroom is like a hospital bathroom. Felt a bit unsafe in this building, and the elevator just did not work. Mind that you will be asked several additional information and admin work to get ""approved"" by the host, after reserving.",NEGATIVE
"Very terrible experience. First of all, I could not check-in and finally had to book another stay. First, the owner sent different details (room no and passcodes) in different messages. Secondly, the door code didn’t open even after dozens of attempts, at this point owner was providing different passcodes(probably he had some backup codes). Finally, he provided a backup link to open the lock but that also didn’t work. Nonetheless, the entire process took 3-4 hours standing in lobby entire time. Another scary moment was in lift, there was a guy (probably drugged and with mafia look with body full of tattoos) and was scolding someone(another guest in same building) in very loud and aggressive voice. This will definitely scare you if you are not a local resident.",NEGATIVE
"It's a good clean flat. Elevator made us many troubles. it is too complicated entering codes on pinpad and it did not work many times and stealed our time ((. I don't honestly understood the host's request to pull off used bedclothes and put them together with used towels on floor near bathroom. It's a duty of room service, which I had paid for.",NEGATIVE
"very nice, the only problem where ants that made our stay a little uncomfy. where not able to cook and leave grocerys in the kitchen.",NEGATIVE
Very clean and organized with a good location. Only downside is the building and hallways were very sterile and did not make it feel very cozy.,NEGATIVE
The apartament doesn't correspond to the photos. There was a bad sewage smell coming from the bathroom. The position is good for the bus stop really close but isn't close to the city centre.,NEGATIVE
"Floor in the kitchen wobbly. Toilet seat with yellow hue (???). Kitchen door broken and impossible to close without force. Equipment outdated apart from the kettle. Cupboards old, painted over and some of them with water damage. The amount of times I walked into the “chandelier”. There was drilling, hammering and God knows what in the apartment above or next to us from 7am…😭😭😭. Road works just made it worse…and people smoking at the entrance… Good location and price, but that’s about it.",NEGATIVE
"Not informative about household information. Did not receive any keys to lock the bedroom, can't close the window to the bedroom doesn't have handles. Said quiet hours is between ""11pm-7am"" but they invited guests over and made lots of noises. Arrives at 9:30pm and left the place at around 11pm the same evening. Overall the host is not very considerate about the guest.",NEGATIVE
It’s a no car zone area. With luggages it’s a tough time.,NEGATIVE
"We loved the location being, stepping out the door and being in the midst of it all. The beds were comfortable and having the half bath was nice. However, there is some neglect of the property that we found disappointing. The AC blows air (loudly) but does NOT cool. Reading reviews, it is evident this has been a problem for several months, with no repair made. When we brought it up, the host acted as if it was a new issue and sent someone over to look at it. After reading reviews stating the AC was broken a couple of months prior, her response felt disingenuous. Would have been better to simply state from the outset that there is an ongoing issue with the AC. There is also a chair that needs repair. For open communication, it should be noted, the refrigerator is elevated. I am 5’10” and I had to stand on a chair to get access to all shelves. If you do not need AC, and don’t need easy access to the fridge, this place will work nicely and give you great access to Gamla Stan!",NEGATIVE
Great location. The only negative was the strong cooking smells from the neighbours. No fault of the property but quite overpowering at times,NEGATIVE
Boat was docked in construction zone with barge with big crane and backhoe blocking view of Old Town. There is a gate with a code to get to the area. No hot water for showers 3 out of 4 days we stayed. The second day the shower drain overflowed and flooded. Olle fixed it when we told him about it. Kitchen is cluttered with Olle’s food leaving little space for food preparation. Cushions from upper deck couch were piled in the stern lounging area (along with a drying rack filled with previous guests towels the first two days) making area uninviting to sit in. Olle was present in the common living space much of the time.,NEGATIVE
The location is great and the place is close to the metro station. I liked that the place was clean and the host was friendly. One thing I would like you to know is that if you’re looking for a room with some privacy then this is not the best choice. I thought I will have a private room with a door but I was a bit disappointed that it’s just the living room separated from the rest of the apartment by curtains. I was unfortunately hearing all sounds and the calls the host was making. So if you want a too social house whom you can talk to then this might work.,NEGATIVE
"We waited for hours in front, with an unresponsive host, only to be told at the end by Airbnb that it was a fake listing and that we should try to find another place. We went to a hotel instead and all our plans for the weekend were messed up. Erik is clearly a scammer.",NEGATIVE
"The place itself was nice. We experienced poor communication from the host; expect slow, unhelpful responses. In particular, we were told we would be given access to laundry via message after asking in advance, and were not able to over our 6-day stay. Additionally, the refrigerator had a putrid, lingering smell that filled the space. Would not stay here again.",NEGATIVE
"The bed was not comfortable, simple and lacking a mattress, I would not recommend this for two persons . Checking in and out was also complicated, needing to get the keys in another building in another street.",NEGATIVE
"Unfortunately the apartment wasn’t cleaned after the previous tenants and the sofa bed was broken. Since we arrived at night and didn’t have any energy to search for alternative, we had to stay one night before relocating to hotel. It wasn’t the best start of the vacation…",NEGATIVE
The kitchen was not very well equipped and there was only 6 chairs around the table,NEGATIVE
"This apartment has a lot of potential. It’s in a well-kept building in an excellent location in the heart of Gamla Stan. It features high ceilings, wood floors and some historic charm. However, it needs some serious maintenance. The bathroom has a foul odor. The shower temperature knob is stuck. The dresser in one of the bedrooms is literally falling apart and unusable. The whole apartment needs a deep cleaning and some aesthetic touches. It feels very “bare bones”. Upon arrival we found the bedding was filthy and had not been changed. The floors and refrigerator were also visibly dirty. The host responded right away and arranged for the cleaning crew come back while we were at dinner. Until these improvements are made, I would not recommend this listing.",NEGATIVE
Olof is responsive. The stove wasn’t working for us and some random person rang the doorbell and tried to come into the apartment at night (we assumed they mistakenly went to the wrong apartment thinking it was theirs).,NEGATIVE
It was good but the place is under construction and not all the elevators work well also hard to get inside and outside also we had no light for like a day,NEGATIVE
"Apartment was disappointing. Facilities resemble (and may have been) a hospital, it becomes apparent when seeing the bathroom. Soundproofing is poor resulting in hearing guests next door. Elevators were difficult to use (others faced troubles too). One night we were calling for one but never came. After struggling a bit we found a solution ourselves, took another one from another entrance the host hadn't informed us about. I must acknowledge the main room & kitchen are exactly as they appear in photos, both look nice. Everything was relatively clean except for stains that resembled blood on the carpet. Lastly, it's unacceptable to ask for social media in order to rent a place. Despite the cleaning fee, you're required to wash the dishes before leaving (what that means for the next guest if previous one hasn't washed them well?), take out the trash, and leave sheets & towels in a specific place (not mentioned in house rules). Check-in is late, they offer to do it earlier for extra cost.",NEGATIVE
"The place is located in a good area, but the the bed and sofa cama were uncomfortable and low quality for the price paid.",NEGATIVE
"Good accommodation, simple but clean and functional. Sound isolation is quite bad though, we have been woken up in the middle of the night by people chatting in the room next-door. We didn't have much interactions with Olof apart from a few automatic messages with complete and precise information.",NEGATIVE
"Good sized apartment in quiet area, but you hear some noise from neighbours. Kitchen equippet with essatials, but a bit dated. The rug in the livingroom is a nightmare, scratchy coconut or other fiver that is very unspleasant to even stand on. Elevators gave us problems twice, there is code for the stairs we might habe missed.",NEGATIVE
"The place looked like a hospital and there was unexpected construction outside that started at 7:30am every morning. The bed and bathroom were significantly worse than advertised, and we were very unhappy with the room. We got half our money back through a complaint, and they were quick about resolving the issue.",NEGATIVE
"Nice apartment but not what we want expected at all, and not like the pictures. Found only one pillow on the bed, one more in the cupboard with no pillow case. Not much bedding available. Very difficult to get into building with many locks, and the elevator stopped working. The windows were difficult to open, one couldn’t open, it was very hot inside but we couldn’t open the window because of outrageously loud noise coming from construction from 6am to the evening. Not very happy.",NEGATIVE
"2/5. Misleading description since the apartment is in a hospital/retirement complex with a strong hospital smell. The sofa bed was not prepared upon arrival and it felt really unhygienic since there were no extra covers for the sofabed and it's pillows and sheets. The apartment gets cleaned by hospital staff who follow basic instructions. There is a large construction site right outside the window. The noise starts early in the morning making it impossible to sleep or relax. There was no water every day after 10 AM due to maintenance. The apartment lacked basic cleaning supplies. The communication with ""Olof"" was mostly automated, and I've noticed that several Airbnbs are being rented by him in the same hospital building. For me, it's unclear if “Olof” truly exists. On the positive side, the location is central, and the apartment was clean due to being part of a hospital. But overall our experience was not pleasant and I wouldn't recommend this place.",NEGATIVE
"Dirty place, hard to enter, multiple key codes to get in. The lift was broken, the room was dim and sad, full of dust and filth. The host pretended he wanted to help but really he just wanted money. The furniture was cheap and tacky, the bed was awful - the cover didn’t fit the bed sheet! You had to make your own bed too. No TV either which was advertised as so to be fair, but still who doesn’t have a TV in any room?",NEGATIVE
"Very clean flat with a good location. There is a supermarket. The bus stop is also just next to the building. However, the check-in time was delayed because of the cleaning was not finished on time. As they were very strict for check in and check out times it would be nice to offer a free late check out. And some items are missing in the kitchen, it would be good to have some sugar and salt. The stove is a bit hard to use and a bit outdated.",NEGATIVE
Overall a clean and roomy space in a good neighborhood. The kitchen and linens were the most bare bones of any airbnb I have stayed in. Only instant coffee provided and not even salt and pepper! So not great if you actually like to cook. But otherwise everything was comfortable and as stated.,NEGATIVE
The stairwell exit door is a hazard and it slams shut. Needs to be fixed.,NEGATIVE
"Nice and afordable place with a great location. Friendly and helpful cleaning staff. Communication wasn't great. the messages were clearly copy/pasted sometimes too many times and sometimes with [insert info] still left in it. Some check-in instructions were not updated to current situation - i.e. an elevator had been decomissioned but we were still told to use it. At one point our door code stopped working and we were locked out of the room. Lucklily they fixed it within 30 minutes, but I saw several other guests who had been locked out during my week long stay.",NEGATIVE
"Our stay at Olof’s apartment was very disappointing. Our biggest issue with the apartment was its location within what I would assume to be an aged care home or an assisted living facility. Although the apartment has been “updated” with new furniture it was still quite clear it was for assisted living - it made us feel like we were staying in a hospital! Very unpleasant feeling to have on a holiday. The bathroom needs a major update- with guard rails for elderly to shower and plastic floors. The hallway and accessing the Airbnb reinforced these assumptions. Accessing the Airbnb was quite time consuming with a different code for the front door, the lift and the apartment. Olof also left an exceptional amount of work to do in check out. Including striping the bed - something required of a hostel not an air bnb. Overall, for what we paid the apartment did not feel worth it. The walk from the train station was also longer than expected - hard with big suitcases.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment doesn’t exactly match the photos. It’s not a nice space, not cosy. Smells funny. Located in what looks like a hospital building. Weird vibe in the house. I didn’t end up using this property, after seeing it - unfortunately!",NEGATIVE
"Excellent value for the location. Everything clean and modern. The code for the lift was really finicky and there were several times that we had to take the stairs as it simply didn't work. Other than that, 10/10",NEGATIVE
"It was an OK place to “crash”. The place had a feeling of a “rehab” or a hospital. The “bathroom” had constant unpleasant sewage smell, it had a public “disabled access toilet/shower” feeling. Kitchen was very basic the “living room” had carpet so rough, sharp and uncomfortable almost sand paper like that I had to put blanket on top of it - to make it walkable with bare feet. The bed was stiff and barely comfortable and it was also two single mattresses pushed together and not a double bed as desired. The apartment also has no plants in it which made it feel even more like a rehab than an apartment. There are many airbnbs in the building almost hotel like except the corridors felt like a hospital ward. The building had regulars maintained happening (drilling every morning at 10am) and some loud (maybe aircon) noises. Had interaction with few guest who were like me having trouble checking in with all the complicated codes and instructions. Would not stay again for that price",NEGATIVE
"I have some back issues and the mattress was way too stiff for me. Other than that, the apartment was nice and comfortable for 1-2p.",NEGATIVE
"The booking process was very weird, unlike I have ever seen. Had to share a lot of personal info (this is already visible on Airbnb), had to sign a weird contract with pretty crazy rules and off Airbnb fines, tried to upsell a lot for earlier check in and discounted extra days (same price as early check in). Overall it was clean, good location, clear check in instructions. Just a weird hosting process.",NEGATIVE
"The toilet and shower room were very clean but the drains smelled very bad. Our son got locked in the toilet for a long time, as the lock didn’t work properly. We didn’t risk locking it again. The radiator by the bed in the sitting room did not work. The location was great, but on the first night there was a strong smell of cannabis in the building.",NEGATIVE
"Central apartment, good for a short city trip. Many sights are in walking distance and there are plenty restaurants close by. The bathroom is not in the best condition and the drain smelled very unpleasant.",NEGATIVE
"This place already received some complaints regarding the curtains (they don't cover really well and both the artificial light from the street lamps at night, and the sun early in the morning, keep you awake). However, nothing seems it has been changed to improve the situation. I hope leaving a clearly bad review will change things, especially considering the fact that the price paid for the place wasn't cheap. For the rest, the place was fine, just like the pictures. We found the bin dirty, though. Be aware that there is no possibility to leave the luggages in the room (not a complaint, as the host was very clear about it).",NEGATIVE
"Pro’s: Good location and peaceful area. Con’s: the Airbnb is run by a group so it doesn’t feel like a home. All of the furniture is IKEA so the apartment feels sterile. The bed and mattress is cheap and uncomfortable - as is the bedding. Synthetic lumpy pillows and duvet. The bed linen was placed on the bed and you had put on the duvet your self…? The kitchen is extremely poorly equipped, didn’t even have basics like salt and pepper - and more shockingly the oven doesn’t even have any shelves? So you cant cook anything - appalling. Communication with Olof was also disappointing. I had specifically asked for the bed AND the sofa bed to be made up as it was myself and my father staying at the apartment. I had messaged Olof TWICE prior to arriving to ensure this was done. When I arrived the sofa hadn’t been made up. Olof didn’t arrange for anyone to make up the sofa bed and even worse didn’t arrange for bed linen to be delivered so I slept on the sofa without linen the entire w/e.",NEGATIVE
"Olof's place is located in a very quaint neighbourhood, some might say it's further out from everything but it's very easily accessible with public transportation and it's really worth the quietness and the waterfront nearby! On Location and noise level 10/10 The main challenge I had was that the apartment was not cleaned from the previous tenant - there was an uncomfortable smell (sewage...) and the fridge was not at all cleaned up. Additionally the instructions to go in were not clear and I got locked in for a while the first night (thankfully it was from the inside though). We eventually solved it. Lastly, the elevators did not work, and I wish this had been communicated early enough. If you have some sort of disability, I'd suggest looking for another accommodation, as this building is unfortunately not appropriate. Shoutout to Olof for helping me out and moving me to another apartment which was 100x better.",NEGATIVE
This particular apartment was in a very nice area of Södermalm with great restaurants. The apartment was clean and spotless with some nice touches but a few too many IKEA products for my liking! Have nothing negative to say other than that it's a bit tricky getting the hang of getting in and out as there are several codes to remember. Not great if you have had a few drinks! The messages seem to be automated and sometimes repetitive and annoying.,NEGATIVE
The flat is located close to bars and restaurants at the heart of Södermalm. The surroundings are nice for running and walks by the waterfront. The flat is clean and functional but feels a bit old and as if it was a service apartment for elderly people. It was disappointing that you need to take care of your own garbage even though you pay a cleaning fee and we were surprised that the owner asked for our social media profiles ahead of accepting our request for booking even though we had a full Airbnb profile with reviews.,NEGATIVE
"Unfortunately, we had some trouble in this apartment. We arrived late at night and one of us got locked in to the bathroom, because the handle was not working properly anymore. It was a complete desaster as we did not know what to do in the middle of the night. When we somehow made it by accident after what felt like hours, we also had a very short sleep due to the construction noise in the morning. There were also instructions for the front door and a potential threat for locking us in, so that we were afraid not to get out and miss our flight. Also, we didnt expect there to be heavy fines for not following the check out instructions (bedsheets waste etc etc). Even though the place was relatively cheap and located well, our experience has been overshadowed by these incidents.",NEGATIVE
"I didn't enjoy my stay. The location was perfect but the place shouldn't be listed on Air BnB. The apartment is aimed at business travelers not folks on vacation. I was expecting a kitchen w/ more than just a microwave & a small fridge. I like to make breakfast before exploring but w/ no stove I was unable to cook. The bathroom is smaller than a closet & the sink so small you can barely wash your face/shave. By accident I got stuck in the building's old elevator. I rang the emergency bell & no one came. I emailed the host from inside the elevator & her response was that she was off given that it was a holiday but that she would come if I needed help. After a few minutes of panic, the elevator worked. The windows shades also weren't working. Once the sun rose at 4 am it would wake me up. I asked the host and she said she was off that day but that the next day she would put new batteries in the remote control. I'd recommend you look for a more suitable place because this isn't worth it.",NEGATIVE
Excellent location however the host was not responsive and hard to get a hold of.,NEGATIVE
Serious hygiene issues the apartment was not somewhere where you could stay. This was because they had not cleaned at all before the last guest so it was all dirty sheets rubbish alcohol hair everywhere total mess. I would avoid staying here as it is a total mess and hygiene issues are so bad. Everything went wrong with the cleanliness luckily I stayed over at a friends it was that bad.,NEGATIVE
"Apartment had not been thoroughly cleaned or checked after the previous guests, floors were dirty. It was in poor condition. Kitchen was lacking some basic utensils. Check-in instructions not very clear. Apartment is in a convenient location, however. I would not recommend staying here.",NEGATIVE
"Many of the pieces of furniture from the pictures matched those in the actual house, but it was not the same room (e.g. different number of windows in the bedroom). I'm somewhat confused how this happened, but I'm not giving this place a low score because of the number of windows. The apartment was presented as a relaxing, homey place near the water. In reality, the building seemed a bit sketchy--it looked like it had recently been converted from an industrial storage facility. I got the feeling that every single room in the entire building was identical, with an iron door and brand new modern decor bought en masse to cover each apartment's austere interior. The experience felt isolating and made me feel uneasy.",NEGATIVE
This location is nice but some details are missing: the blackout blinds are only in the bedroom so the living room with the sofa bed is very bright. We were not provided with a kitchen towel or dish sponge. There is a dishwasher but the soap is not provided. Hallway noise can be very loud. It would be nice to have the cooking oil and coffee replenished.,NEGATIVE
"Basically no stay, due to Apartment significant different to pictures/description - seemingly error in providers booking system.",NEGATIVE
"Room had not been cleaned prior to our arrival. The previous guests sheets and towels were left in the apartment in a pile, including their food and drinks. We did not receive any sheets or towels until mid day the following day. Additionally the water was shut off for 8 hours on our 3rd day (including loud construction) which was not disclosed to us until the last minute.",NEGATIVE
"Olof’s apartment was in a great location and very comfortable. His communication leading up to the stay was good. However, when we went to check in (at 3pm after being denied any option for an early checkin), we found the cleaning staff was just starting to clean the unit and she said it would not be ready until 4:30. We had to be somewhere at 5pm and had just arrived to Stockholm from international flights, so this was highly inconvenient. Olof had given us no notice about this and when I let him know this was quite disruptive to our plans, he simply stated that we could leave the bags in the apartment. Several times during our stay, the elevator would not come or would not open on the ground floor and when I asked Olof for the code to the stairs, he just said to use the door code (which did not work). The hallway also smelled really bad and the building itself was quite dirty. I would definitely stay in Sodermalm during a future Stockholm trip, but would not recommend this apartment",NEGATIVE
"Great location and overall smooth checking in and out. Unfortunately, the weather was 26 degrees this week, and the apartment has no air conditioning. We requested fans but were told by Olof after nearly two days of communications that they could not provide these. We had a few uncomfortable nights due to this. Additionally in the amenity section an iron and toaster are listed - these are both missing (despite there being an ironing board). When we contacted Olaf, again, a very slow determination eventually led to him saying that these also would not be provided. We were dissatisfied with this as these are basic things any apartment should have. Olaf kindly waived the cleaning fee for us as a means of an apology. A few things that are also missing: cleaning products (dust pan and brush, broom/hoover), kitchen spray, kitchen towels, minimal toilet roll, side table in second bedroom, sanitary bins, bed side lights in second bedroom. We would stay again if these changes were made.",NEGATIVE
"Nice location, Nice apartment, however many problems in the building, lift was broken all the time and no access to the stairs code (door is locked). When booking make sure you have the code to also go in the stairs. We had to wait for a long time, as we could not get inside.",NEGATIVE
The place is totally not tourist friendly. Do not suggest foreigner to stay there at all. The elevator was not working the whole time and the host did jot offer any help at all. We had to carry a 25kg luggage going up and down. And the lock was kinda confusing. Suggested to state clearer instruction for the guests. It was also quite bothering that the host kept texting us to see if we want to top up for late check up.,NEGATIVE
The apartment itself was nice. Great size for 3 guests and good location. However we were not told that the elevator was broken upon arrival - not ideal with our large luggage bags and the host was not very responsive when trying to contact them.,NEGATIVE
"Flat was clean and similar to photos, but does not live up to any definition of an ""urban oasis""; it's basic accommodation in a style reminiscent of a dormitory or youth hostel. The fridge is newer but the rest of the kitchen is Swedish 90s/American 70s. There is some issue with the lifts and the trash chutes were filled-up past the second floor. I don't want to trash this property, if you are ok with the location, 10 minute walk to SOFO, looking for a tidy, no-frills stay and the price is right go for it, I was expecting more.",NEGATIVE
"The lock was broken upon arrival and we were locked out for close to an hour. The host was very slow to respond and answered with generic questions and replies instead of calling us right away when we said it was an emergency. The phone number on the listing does not work. We asked for him to call us several times and provided our number stating it was an emergency, which he ignored repeatedly. The locksmith came the next day, however we lost half the day waiting around because the host didn’t provide an ETA. They only gave us a one night refund in exchange for the inconvenience. Expect a very transactional stay in a former medical apartment with a bathroom door that gets jammed easily and a poor piping system that causes the kitchen sink area to smell like trash. If you’re looking for purely functional lodging off the downtown area and are ok with poor communication when you encounter problems, this would be the place.",NEGATIVE
"Quite affordable, so to some extent you get what you pay for. And the place is not bad - it was extremely clean and is quite spacious. However, the bathroom is almost impossibly small. I was traveling alone, so I didn't care, but even just one couple would struggle to both get ready in the morning in that bathroom. The unit is also not well stocked - the shower was completely empty of materials and I had to buy body wash just to take an actual shower (which I left for the next people).",NEGATIVE
"Too many Instructions, Too many times reminders, Too many Task for cleaning. Even when we pay the cleaning cost to the Air BNB. Not interetsed to solve our issues like Gas stove was not working. I was not able to use it. What is the purpose of booking the flat when i am not able to use it? The Dishwasher had no cleaning soap. The floor was making so much noice. Overall not happy. Sorry i had to put this review so that Air BNB looks in to this matter.",NEGATIVE
"The flat is beautiful and it is very well located. My only disappointment was with the state of the bathroom which was not up to the level that should have been giving the beauty of the flat and the prize. It was too old and not in great shape, mirror missing and not very clean",NEGATIVE
"was disappointed and I was very disapponted and uncomfortable. I made an appointment with the host at 9 o'clock because the shower was broken and there were no cutting boards and pans to cook. However, she didn’t come until 10 o'clock. I talked to the host on the phone call, but she didn't aplogize. There were no shampoo, no sugar, no kitchen towel, and no scrub sponge, so I was supposed to buy these items. There were so many blond long hair on a sofa bed. A traveler's time is different from a resident's time. I was supposed to spend my time to buy basic items such as sugar, shampoo, and scrub sponge to stay the apt.",NEGATIVE
"Nice place, quick response from the host with the troubles we had. One of the bathrooms stopped working which was unfortunate.",NEGATIVE
She canceled our reservation at the last minute and put us in a difficult situation,NEGATIVE
"The apartment is nice, in a good neighborhood, and close to the Subway. But the shower is leaky, and the kitchen is poorly equipped ( e.g., no microwave, no toaster ). The description of the kitchen equipment given in Airbnb is not correct. And, we got the impression that Hedvig was not really interested in addressing our problems.",NEGATIVE
"The place is large and fit our needs. Dishwasher does not work, needs black out blinds, very old house and needs some updates. We thought fit our needs and house was large.",NEGATIVE
"We were excited after booking what looked like a fantastic place to have a wonderful family time.We started having doubts with the host towards the onset of the stay when all our queries re baby colts, checkin,etc were total ignored.On arrival we were shocked with the overgrown dirty garden & filthy house filled with stench,leaks from the roof,taps,toilets,etc.The fact that we arrived about 1AM with babies was the reason we didn’t look for another place.The house is with only 1 horrible shower that you can’t stand upright in with leak at every bit.The shower curtain is so dirty & smelly it is unbelievable.The other bath upstairs is so small you can only sit in & there is no head room to stand up/room to manoeuvre to scrub oneself.The bedrooms are horrible with exposed wiring in one of the rooms upstairs; how was this place signed off for habitation? Airbnb should consider allowing photos in reviews.The infuriating thing came when host sent coercing request for a 4/5-star review.This wi",NEGATIVE
"The place didn't match listing photos, different wall colors, was not cleaned properly, some tv cable was hanging on the walls, then we found what looked like potato chips around the curtains, that was just the beginning cause after that we started checking and found that kitchen also was different, with more cabinets in light color, dust and crumbles under the bed, spider webs on ceiling, walls and vents, dust on kitchen's windows. In the bathroom, besides been different than listing pictures, WC stained. Terrible experience. Had to spend the night there, cause tbh, was too late to find a hotel and Airbnb's support, when trying to find another place to stay, was pretty useless, also site failed a lot at the moment. We booked a hotel through Booking app, more expensive, but cleaner. Next day I asked Airbnb's support and host to return remaining nights and cleaning fee, just paid for the night we spent there. Host was pretty friendly and returned the money on same day.",NEGATIVE
"I've been an Airbnb user for 15 years. This is the first truly negative review I've ever had to write here. My husband and I booked this apartment with the understanding, based on its description, that it accommodated four guests. My mom was to join us a few days into our stay. We chose this for its location (close to Metro) and price. It does deliver on these two points. Immediately, we noticed that the apartment was unclean when we arrived (hair everywhere, dirty pan in the oven, bathroom smelled, all soaps watered down) and that its online photos had been heavily ""filtered."" Things really went downhill when my mom arrived and the pull-out couch was broken and couldn't support a person's weight. We asked for this to be replaced, and it was replaced with another equally broken couch. My 75-year-old mother slept on a chaise longue the entire trip. The only upside here was that we got a partial refund.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment I was given was very different from what was shown in the pictures of the listing. We were placed in another one without being notified. The one we were placed in was not as good as the one we were expecting (the bathroom was old, there was no washing machine, and there was no functioning dishwasher). I would NOT recommend this host. Because of the above problems with the apartment, I didn’t have a good feeling about the whole management. Just one example: trash can only be disposed of in a designated room in the building, and we got the key only three days later after many message exchanges with the host. The same key also opened the laundry room in the building. At some point, the host even attempted to convince me that my booking did not include the said amenities. In addition to not being able to dispose of the trash or do laundry, my frustration led me to contact Airbnb. I got a standard partial refund from AirBnB.",NEGATIVE
"Very good location, close to public transportation, but the condition of the apartment was very bad, creaked floor, doors, electricity was constantly cut off when we wanted to boil water, so it had to be heated on the stove in a pot. The kitchen has all the appliances you need. There is a kettle and coffee machine in the kitchen, but you can't use them because of bad wiring, otherwise the lights go out everywhere. The soap in the bathroom was not filled up. There are no sockets in the bathroom, so I had to dry our hair in the hallway. The bedroom only fits a bed and nothing else would fit in there. The hostess herself was very friendly and we were very pleased with her.",NEGATIVE
"both of the hosts are nice and frierndly but parking its very difficult and strickt ,i got a big fine for not knowing exactly the parking rules, infact parking its stressing",NEGATIVE
"Pros: Good price, okay location. Cons: Most of the elevators in the building weren't working correctly, as they opened up but wouldn't take you down to the main floor. There were also no stairs to get up and down the floors of the building which I found a bit strange. None of this was communicated beforehand, and there were no notices next to the elevators. Additionally, the long corridors that led from the elevator to my apartment were barely lit up, with certain parts being completely pitch dark. This gave a very shady vibe of the whole apartment building.",NEGATIVE
"While it was clean, we had a weird feeling about the apartment and building. Everything seemed like it had recently been purchased from IKEA and badly put together. All the drawers looked like they had never been used. To get inside we had to enter what seemed like a school building and go up a side staircase with graffiti and construction dust in the hallway. The host's messages were from a generated template that made it seem like he was managing a lot of other apartments. What felt really odd is that we ran into another couple staying in the building, who had booked on booking. com what looked like the same apartment with the same pictures as our listing on Airbnb. Running into others, it seemed the like building was full of tourists. In his messages to us, Olof said this was his home so please respect the neighbours, but this felt disingenuous. Overall it was a fine stay in a slightly sketchy-building that felt like it had recently been turned from an old school into apartments.",NEGATIVE
There was some unexpected loud noise in the morning (at 8am) due to construction. Other than that the apartment was clean and in a peaceful neighborhood. The walk to the apartment was quite long (the hallways were extremely long and dark at night). The apartment had a weird smell.,NEGATIVE
The place is alright but not cozy at all.,NEGATIVE
"Olof’s place is “situated on the first floor of quaint house”, aka the third floor of an unkempt massive retirement home/doctor’s office/school. Between the Portuguese ravers that kept partying past midnight (with no response from Olof until the next day) and the apartment’s unavoidable safety features that are quite literally for people with Alzheimer’s, it felt like I was taking crazy pills for three days straight. The building has a bunch of graffiti in the hallways, gross elevators, and is overall a very strange place to spend time within. The apartment itself was clean, but also very sterile. The management company clearly has bought old retirement units and is renting them at a massive upcharge. Since the units on either side of you are also airbnbs, there really is no guarantee of having peace and quiet. I would recommend others simply spend the money on more enjoyable crazy pills of their own choosing. Airbnb customer service will not help you if you feel unsafe here.",NEGATIVE
"In general, the apartment was fine and very clean. However, there were a few things we found weird. It made us uncomfortable to be asked about social media accounts during the booking and it seemed like they tried to hide the fact that this is a very commercial provider, not a private host. (They have several identical apartments in this building). Also, the apartments seem to be originally planned for disabled / elderly renters (e.g you have to activate a timer to use the kitchen). There was a lot of construction noise, which is now part of the description but wasn‘t when we booked the apartment.",NEGATIVE
Unfortunately there is pile driving/drilling for a new tunnel immediately outside and underneath this apartment complex. From 7.30am to 6.15pm every weekday. The noice is unbearable to sit in the apartment.,NEGATIVE
"At 7am M-F, there was extremely loud construction (pile-driving pillars into the ground) it was impossible to sleep through this.",NEGATIVE
"I intended to write just a good review about an apartment’s nice and quiet location, very clean, convenient transportation and good neighborhood. But want to share our unbelievable bad experience we had at the end of our stay. We ordered to Olof a transportation to airport with exact online documented time, address, airport name, and flight number. Olof asked us to pay for the transportation online in advance and we did it. Next morning we got out of our building 10 minutes before our time. Nobody came. We were waiting for a half an hour. After that we took a way to airport by ourself. Next day from another city of our traveling having internet we sent a message to Olof asking what happened. Olof said us as per driver we were not on this place (our apartment location where we stayed for a week) and at this time and even our payment cannot be refunded. We never even heard about something like this for tens of years of our traveling including many times using Airbnb.",NEGATIVE
"These apartments are staged cleverly in the photos. In person it's clear they were built for the elderly or as a winter shelter or gov housing, since all the plugs and appliances have short timers, the bathroom looks like it belongs in a hospital, there was a constant bad odor, the grade of the building materials (flooring, counters, etc) is extremely cheap and old, and the maintenance of the building is terrible (elevators, stairwell, exterior) and they leave the lights off at night adding to the creepy wtf is going on factor. My apartment was not like the photos (they have many units in this building and use one listing for all) the mattress was so thin and firm I slept on the sofa, there was construction noise, the linens and toilet paper were hospital quality. Do yourself a favor and book somewhere else.",NEGATIVE
"The studio is small but expensive. The shower area doesn’t have a separation which led to water spread all over the bathroom and we had to clean it manually. There was not enough basic toiletries ( no body lotion). The host was responsive, close to Coop convenience store and bus stop.",NEGATIVE
"Overall, the experience was mediocre. The booking required you to enter your social media, which we do not have. Another review raised the same criticism and the response was that this was required for verification. This sounds absurd as they already had our ID cards. Communication in general was not good, required information was buried in long messages and questions were asked repeatedly e.g. if we want to extend our stay although we denied this the first time. Questions we asked were not properly answered in time e.g. if the repairs affect our warm water supply. The apartment was clean and located in a nice area, with supermarkets, restaurants, ... being close-by, but the apartment itself was smaller than the ones advertised. It was mentioned that the apartment might look different, but there was e.g. no desk, despite being mentioned in the description. There were no basics like salt, pepper, oil, ... as well as no vacuum cleaner despite the large carpet in the middle of the room.",NEGATIVE
"I generally always leave a 5-star review, even if I didn't absolutely love the place, but I was really left a bit disappointed by this experience. Olof was fine and responsive, but here were my issues: 1. There was construction noise that sounded like someone was drilling or jackhammering into the roof above the bed from pretty early. 2. The check-in process required repeated asking for more and more personal information information. This would be less of an issue if all just asked for at once, it makes the experience feel like a chore before it's begun. 3. The check-in instructions made sense for me, but Olof manages multiple Airbnbs within the same building and their check-in instructions are similar to the point where multiple times I had people knocking or trying to enter my apartment. 4. The actual building itself feels like you're in a hospital ward, and the apartment lacks homeliness of what I generally expect from Airbnb. Genuine pros: Super fast internet and great location",NEGATIVE
"Clean apartment, in a great area with easy access to the bus to get into the city centre. Olof is very responsive and provides very clear instructions for getting into the apartment. One downside I would say is that the apartment is lacking a TV, but this disappointment was not due to any misleading on behalf of the host, it was just an assumption I had made based on previous rentals.",NEGATIVE
"The location is great! The apartment itself looks good overall, however: the bathroom is a total mess. It doesnt look as described, the last thing we wanted to do is taking a shower there. This problem sadly didnt get adressed by the host.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is good, however the area seemed a bit sketchy. Too many drunk people around, shouting. The place outside the windows was filthy.",NEGATIVE
"The appartement itself was fine, but the account is clearly automated and the building itself is really unwelcoming and cold. The check-out time was suddenly moved to 9am (compared to 11am as listed) and the cleaning crew was informed we would be gone by 8am, so they were suddenly in our room. Would not come here again due to the impersonal treatment.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment complex resembles a psychiatric ward, which is a little disconcerting. The bathroom smells of raw sewerage. The bed is cheap and uncomfortable. The linen is hospital standard. I would not recommend. Close to public transport and in a nice location, find somewhere nearby - it’s a nice neighbourhood.",NEGATIVE
Location fantastic. But: super smelly bathroom. And we were absolutely stunned the host didn’t mention the major construction site right next to the apartment. Happy to provide videos of the heavy equipment used from early in der morning. How can this not be taken into consideration / be mentioned upon booking?! Super irritating.,NEGATIVE
"The building started operating at 7am, causing extreme noise and making it impossible to use the apartment. The host just mentioned that there might be some noise, but we actually felt cheated because it was very loud and annoying. the apartment should not be for rent while there is work on the old building, which is practically uninhabitable. So, our experience was not really pleasant. Apart from this problem, the space is good and clean.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment itself was fine (clean and spacious) and the host really informative. However, the experience was affected by the non-existent soundproofing! The residents upstairs made so much noise every night that we could not sleep even one night. This is a real shame but understandably it spoiled our experience.",NEGATIVE
Just DON’T . It’s inside A hospital! Had construction making noise . Host wooden refund . Stains on carpet . Not comfortable bed .,NEGATIVE
"during our stay we had 2 problems. first was that the appartment hadnt everything it was supposed to (bedsheets, pillowcases, duvets and towels) and we had to ask twice for them to be delivered while providing a list of what was missing, for them to be half-delivered at the end, because we never got enough towels for the 4 of us. the other was that there was some leakage on the wall above the stove(as if it wasnt that well cleaned) and we also saw a cockroach. another thing i didnt completely understand was all the paperwork we had to go through to book this appartment. generally it was good, in a great location in the city center with a lot to see around. everything was at walkable distance. the place was clean and tidy when we arrived and very spacious for the 4 of us. Olof was easy to communicate with and replying fast. overall our experience was a 3-3.5/5. thank you for our staying there, we really enjoyed our time in sweden.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment was ok, but it did not match the high quality vibe of the pictures. It is located in a complex with hundreds of those apartments, looking very dystopian and bleak. The entry code given did not work on both elevators as described. It is a single big room with bed and sofa. The bed had the thinnest mattress I have ever seen and a single flat cushion. The showers were smelly when used, probably due to the sewage system. The walls are very thin, I heard neighbours next and above me. There was also a construction site inside the building right next to my room, but this was known beforehand. The apartment only contained things that were absolutely necessary, it did not have character at all. Together with the massive amount of rooms next to each other, it really felt like mass processing and overpriced. I also received the same offer from the host 3x for early check-in for a fee. Overall, this apartment is OK and you can sleep there, but overpriced and not a good vibe.",NEGATIVE
"The was easily the worst experience I’ve had in the 6 years I’ve been using Airbnb. When we arrived, we realized that the room was inside of a retirement-style hospital building that was under extreme construction. Olof completely misrepresented and understated the extent of the noise on the posting. In addition, the room was unbearably hot, but when we opened the window, the construction noise was 10x louder and there were no screens, leading to tons of bees and bugs ending up in the room (We had killed 6-8 bees inside the room by the time we left). When we reached out to Olof to provide a fan, he said that it would not be provided and we would need to purchase one ourselves. We also asked for a few extra pillows because the ones provided were extremely thin, and Olof told us “sure, they just come at a charge :)”. This room is not suitable for anyone to be living/sleeping in - no matter if it is cheaper than other options. Do yourself a favor and do not make this booking!",NEGATIVE
Very late checkin (4pm) and early checkout (10am) that wasnt clearly communicated. Half of the day gone due to these weird checkin and checkout hours,NEGATIVE
"The place was nice, situated in a pleasant neighbourhood and very accessible. However, I didn’t like the bathroom; it had a weird design and didn’t match the pictures. Communication with the host was also frustrating—it felt like interacting with a robot. The host kept repeatedly offering late checkout options that weren’t available, and every time I replied that I was interested, I was informed that the late checkout option wasn't actually available. I felt a disconnect in the communication. Other than the bathroom and the annoying, unavailable checkout offers, I enjoyed staying at the place.",NEGATIVE
"Appartement was good, but the bathroom had a horrible smell.",NEGATIVE
"When I arrived the place smelled of smoke and was not very clean. It did not match the photos and there was no workstation as advertised. Also, as a female, I did not feel comfortable with the location. Olof, the contact for GuestIt, was helpful and refunded my money.",NEGATIVE
"I was quite disappointed with my stay at this Airbnb. The space was much smaller than I expected from the photos, making it feel cramped and uncomfortable. Additionally, the hallway leading to the apartment had a very unpleasant smell, which made coming and going unpleasant. There were also some unsettling encounters with people in the building, including a homeless man who tried to sneak into the elevator with us, which made me feel unsafe. To make matters worse, the bathroom had a lingering odor that wasn’t pleasant, which made using the space less than enjoyable. Finally, there were unexpected fees if you didn’t follow specific check-out instructions, which were only sent one day before check-out—leaving little time to prepare. Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this place, especially if you’re looking for a comfortable, stress-free stay.",NEGATIVE
"It was a pretty nice Airbnb, the only thing that kind of bothered me was all the penalties one gets with the exact price. I do understand that in some cases it is necessary, but seeing that we didn’t feel welcome. The whole building was a bit scary, but everything else was ideal.",NEGATIVE
"Very hospital like environment, corridor leading to the apartment felt like a warehouse. Bathroom felt like a hospital bathroom, no toilet paper holder, very sterile. Lots of rules and communication about Fees If we forgot to strip the sheets for example. All this made the experience very unwelcoming , Everything seemed to have a fee. Cold, impersonal atmosphere. It will be another place next time.",NEGATIVE
House doesn’t match images on Airbnb,NEGATIVE
"The place does not look the same as it looks on the picture. It’s small, the shower is terrible, and the bed is not confortable.",NEGATIVE
"Communication felt mostly automated but was clear. Whilst the apartment was very cheap but there were clear reasons for this- There was an awful smell coming from the bathroom, I didn’t report this because I noticed on reviews it had been mentioned many times. The bathroom and kitchen were more dated than the photos (they rent many units in the building). There was a diffuser used to cover up the bathroom smell and my friend and I both had allergic reactions to either this or the washing powder used on bedding (waking up with swollen eyes). The double bed has 2 single mattresses covered by thin topper and a single duvet rather than full size covering as the image, which means you have to sleep as if a single. The building is very stark with metal doors to the apartments which felt a bit like a facility, making us quite nervous on arrival, also no way to deadlock door from inside we felt a bit unsafe. On our last night there was screaming/shouting and sounds of furniture being moved",NEGATIVE
"Be aware that Olof doesn’t exist. It is a scam supported by Airbnb. The place is great, but I really dislike being cheated. Olof is in fact a company name Guestit. somewhere an Airbnb competitor. I still don’t get why Airbnb need their listing. Pretty sure Airbnb will censor this review. For the story we also get stuck outside, at midnight, because the code to get in the flat had changed and they forgot to inform us.",NEGATIVE
"had stayed in ""same"" apartment 2 months previously. Photos of new, 2nd reservation were identical to the old. reservation communication to Olaf, ""glad to be coming back to same apartment!"". he put us in a room half the size as the prior apartment. claimed ""slight variability"" clause permitted this. He then lied and claimed I had booked a different room type... to which I asked, ""Why are the photos identical for a completely different room type?"". He is a liar and a thief.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment itself was OK. Newly renovated, bright and clean. It is located in the residential area, from where you can easily reach the central part of the city. There are some restaurants in walking distance. However there are other things which make it not so great: - there is a construction site right under the window, so you get a mandatory wakeup call at 7:30. Yes, it is mentioned in the description - second bedroom has no windows and the bed barely fits in it - there is a whole bunch of the requirements, rules, and obligations the manager of this property bombards you with. You need to provide your FB and linkedin account - you need to confirm in writing that you will comply with their rules, otherwise you won't be given the check in instructions - I got 7 nagging reminders that I have to check out by 11 for the 5 days I was staying there. - the corridor smells horribly - the light in the corridor is turned off at 7pm - elevators randomly stop opening doors",NEGATIVE
"Most important thing to note is that this listing uses photos of a completely different apartment, which is false adverising. When we got here and realized that the apartment has no tub, just a drain in the bathroom floor for a shower, no exhaust in the kitchen, no full sized fridge, no kettle, different kitchen cabinets, etc, we realized it’s a different unit and let the hosting company know, asking whether perhaps they gave us the wrong unit. They agreed that maybe we got the wrong unit and asked for photos, which we sent. They then took days to get back to us and instead of being honest and transparent and offering to move us to the apartment in the same building which they had sold us on, they tried to gaslight us and “assured” us that the apartments are “identical” except for the decorations which is dishonest. Many issues with unit- shower had mold, fridge with leftover food, laundry system could not be used, stove didn’t work for 5 days, light in some rooms not working etc",NEGATIVE
"I booked because nothing else was available near where I needed to be. It was twice the price of others in the area, and I expected a certain luxury. Paint was peeling in the kitchen and bathroom, lights were not even fitted (larger bedroom, balcony, bathroom cabinet) and kitchen equipment was lacking. There were no pots and pans for cooking (only 1 wok), and no kitchen knives. An appliance has been removed from the kitchen (dish washer?), leaving loose floor tiles. The apartment cannot accommodate 5, as advertised. There are 2 single beds in bedroom 1, and a childs bed (not suitable for an adult) in bedroom 2. There is no air conditioning, and in warm weather the apartment is stuffy. Windows open a little, but not enough for adequate ventilation. The positive features are: near local shops and transport, quiet area. Overall, I would advise to book elsewhere.",NEGATIVE
"Excellent location! But not much else... Washing machine broken, open sauna in bathroom is just a storage room, water from the shower runs away from the drain and floods the bathroom. Needed to line the shower doors with towels and have quick showers! Unreliable internet. Multiple bags of stuff? along one wall of the bedroom. 3 sets of stairs to the front door then 2 more to the bedroom. Something to consider if you're travelling with a bit of luggage! Also, never heard from David again after booking. Didn't reply to msgs... Would not stay again",NEGATIVE
"The place is as advertised, just located in a clinic/hospital which was kind of weird? And the host only replies with auto generated messages and is very insistent on asking for link to social media accounts of the guests which should not be ok since my profile is verified via airbnb",NEGATIVE
"Avoid this place at all costs, unless you really only need a place to sleep late night and early morning. The listing’s warning of “some noise due to construction” belies the existence of a massive construction site of what appears to be a skyscraper directly outside all of the windows of the listing. Balconies in the kitchen are covered over entirely by blue construction materials. Construction workers show up at 7, begin talking (which you can hear through the thin glass), and then start jackhammering by 7:30a. The rest of the place is mediocre. Hallways getting in are flickering and reminiscent of an asylum. The second bedroom has no windows. Only two pillow cases and a single towel were provided. The host kept trying to push communication through Google forms instead of Airbnb and wants a lot of personal information like socials up front (although he did make an exception after we made a fuss). The neighborhood is great. Just chose another place nearby and enjoy.",NEGATIVE
"There is a lot of construction going on between 7.30 & 20.00 o'clock. Also for the upcoming weeks or months. Unable to talk inside and open windows. So a lack of oxygyn. The hallway is dark and creepy. My daughters felt scared. Very unpersonal. I used 3 different codes to get in door, elevator & appartment. The owner oens at least 36 appartments. Besides all that, clean appartment, great city.",NEGATIVE
"Terrible experience with this place. I booked it for me and my family. When I arrived not only was it uncleaned but there were other people’s stuff in there! He had double booked it (probably on another app) and had other guests staying there when it should have been vacant and cleaned! As an Airbnb host myself, this is completely unacceptable. The only thing good I will say is he was quick to respond, but that doesn’t nullify the terrible experience I had. I had to get 2 hotel rooms last minute because of his inability to properly manage his airbnbs booking schedule.",NEGATIVE
"When we arrived the lock didn't work and we were left for about 15 mins waiting for the assistant to find keys. There was a smell of urine in the bathroom, not properly cleaned. The apartment looked out on to a massive industrial building site so the park view was spoilt and it was incredibly noisy, so much so that we couldn't open the window in the summer, unless we wanted the sound of loud drilling. Olaf did mention the building site in the ad, but the sheer size of it, and the drilling from 7am to 7pm made this a poor quality stay. The endless grey corridors in the building also make it feel like a prison. Inside of the apartment was tastefully designed though. Olaf was proactive with our concerns.",NEGATIVE
"One bedroom without windows, broken bathroom lock, excessive checkout instructions.",NEGATIVE
They have multiple airbnb in the same building. We didn't get the same as on the Fotos but in general it was alright but quite pricy. Not a lot of utilities for cooking. The bathroom is not very nice. it was okej but I would not go again.,NEGATIVE
"The flat, and others in the building, are run as a business. So go elsewhere if you are looking for a cosy, welcoming home from home done through a friendly local host. Guests are required to go through rather fiddly checks and to take time to fill in forms, Given this, while communication for the most part was good, I was disappointed by the failure of communication on a couple of things: - I pre-arranged and paid for early check-in but, when just about to arrive at the property, an agent told me it was not possible to do early check in. This was rectified quickly but came as a surprise - In the form I was asked to complete after booking, I asked for two beds in separate rooms, but only one was made up That apart. the flat was a good base in a quiet, conveniently located neighbourhood for a shoot I was doing in Stockholm. While the building itself was rather unprepossessing, the flat inside was nice - cosy and tastefully done up.",NEGATIVE
We did early check out with informing the landlord but he didn’t help us in any case.,NEGATIVE
"House was dirty so we did not stay . We got our $ back . But I had never experienced this situation before . Rent a lot thru VRBO and Air BnB . That apartment looked as if it was not cleaned for weeks . Bad smell the moment you opened the door . In one of bedroom you have to squeeze yourself to get it as bed is too close to door . It won’t open fully . I was so disappointed with whole experience especially when you have old parents with you . We had to look again and book hotels , which costed me more . Please Mr Albin - check your apartment before you rent out . If it was mistake - hope this was first and you last mistake",NEGATIVE
"The place per se is okay. But it is clearly optimized to look good on pictures and not to work well as a flat. Kitchen equipment is minimal, and there is neither a dishwasher nore a reasonable way to do the dishes as there is no drying towels. Everything just feels not too inviting.",NEGATIVE
"Albin was communicating well at the beginning, gave good instructions for the house and check in was easy to do. Location is also great if one wants to be close to Konstfach university. Unfortunately, when we arrived the cutlery was missing, we had to buy from supermarket some which we shouldnt as are supposed to be included in this studio list. In addition, the cooking pans were in a very bad condition. Also, the wardrobe sliding door was damaged/broken, we couldnt make full use of the wardrobe. I sent him pictures soon we arrived and he said he will take care of the wardrobe, which didnt happen until we left. As far as the cutlery concerns he ignored my message. Overall ok, but there are things he could improve like be honest with what is included in the studio,provide good maintenance,provide pans /pots/ cutlery in good condition and an electric kettle. Boiling water in the saucepan to make a tea is funny.",NEGATIVE
"We stayed a few days and the host was nice to allow an early check in.. the apartment is ok But few things needs to be fixed From the previous guest same issue was mentioned and the host didn’t find a solution to it, which was bad . No knives No spoon No fork And the bathtub wasn’t not the best because the water doesn’t goes away easily after a shower, which is not nice to be having same dirty water on your feet after shower . But apart from this the apartment and host was good.. just 10mins walk to the telefonplan metro stop .",NEGATIVE
The apartment is as described but the neighborhood is not safe. We had 2 bikes stolen while staying there. Do not leave anything of value in or attached to your car.,NEGATIVE
"Extremly run-down, partly dirty (e.g. sofa), loud (many bars around), windows do not close/open properly, bathroom extremly small and looks nothing like the pictures- no shower tray and old shower curtain. Be aware that there‘s no elevator.",NEGATIVE
"Not very happy. Very dirty sofa, I didnt use the shower at all, curtains very dirty, kitchen counters - I wiped them myself.. coffee table dirty.. floors dirty, didnt want to use kitchen as well.. Hair dryer didnt work and I think it is a fire hazzard, I wanted to dry my t-shirt, thankfully no wet hair was involved since I didn't want to use the shower considering overall it was not very clean. Bed is not comfortable and it is squeeky, wind going through the roof window right above the bed... and some wierd noise during the night. We asked for more towels, didn't get them even though Stefan said he will bring them. Positives: it was warm (good for winter weather), location is perfect.. good for one night stay if you reaaaally don't have better option...",NEGATIVE
"Communication was great until I found that there was mold in the bathroom; once this issue was brought up and pictures were shared with StayPlus, communication was slow and they were clearly unwilling to do anything about the mold. Repeatedly mentioned potentially talking to the cleaning manager about the issue after my stay was done but in the meantime I felt uncomfortable and unsafe showering in, again, a shower with black mold. Also there was no thermostat in the unit and it was extremely hot at night when day time temperatures were upwards of 80°F.",NEGATIVE
Got instructions and was told that door was to be unlocked; arrived and door was locked. Messaged/called host through three different platforms and then had to wait 15 min before getting a response. Dirty dishes and cups in the cupboards. Blackout curtains were not wide enough so a lot of light streamed through.,NEGATIVE
"Nice little place, but all the host messages are automated (they sent the same one twice) and when I had an issue with the apartment being extremely hot the first night, I was sent a form to fill out. Never got a reply. I really needed a fan to stay another night and also help finding the window blinds (I did realize they were there eventually but a quick easy message from a real host would have solved this.) I left the apartment after the first night - no response from the host, no effort to resolve anything, just a partial automatic refund. This is not the type of airbnb experience that reflects well on Airbnb as a whole. It is an apartment managed by a company that has canned responses and doesn’t care to solve an issue if there is one. Felt like airline customer service without a human. Couch also had stains on it and looked like it hadn’t been washed in years. Looks nice in the photos, but needs replaced or heavy laundering. I moved to a hotel in the end.",NEGATIVE
"Reveiw isn't meant to be harsh, but no option to say N/A in the star ratings. Unfortunately Anna cancelled the booking hours before we checked in due to problems with neighbours so a normal review hasn't been possible on this occasion.",NEGATIVE
"Had some trouble with the key system and the host was not particularly quick to respond and fix the issues. Other than that, affordable accommodation without unnecessary luxuries.",NEGATIVE
"Here is the thing, upon checking in, the place was not clean, had a clogged sink, it was smelly and there were no sanitary product available at all. There was mold in the fridge and it smelled catastrophically. So that colors the rest of my stay in terms of this review. BUT! The bed was made, so at least I could sleep there the first night. It took them two days to fix the sink, and when it came to “cleaning” the apartment they chose to provide me with cleaning supplies so that I could clean the place myself. They swabbed the fridge in such a hurry that it was still just as unsanitary as a latrine-pit when they finished. When I came home that day, the actual door handle was broken too, so they had to send a repairman to fix that. As per usual, it was still broken after they had “mended” it. There is no recommendation to be made for this apartment",NEGATIVE
"Trashy bed linen, oven did not work, door hard to open for my girlfriend",NEGATIVE
Great location and cute place. Stove did not work.,NEGATIVE
Host cancel my booking 7 hours before check in,NEGATIVE
"The landlord cannot be contacted when I arrived at the target place on the check-in day, and I can only be forced to cancel the order the next day and find new house source again.",NEGATIVE
"Was shocked when I was asked to pay for repair. The kitchen was small with no ventilation (smoke was fed back to kitchen!), and smoke alarm. Very dangerous to cook.",NEGATIVE
The place is just like normal. It is bit far from station and there is no free parking available. Room was small and blanket was not cleaned. Owner was responsive but not committed on check-in and check-out time.,NEGATIVE
"What was good: Central location, easy to check in, well equipped kitchen What was not good: we were told that we could check in from 1pm but when we arrive at 2:30pm, the apartment was not cleaned. We booked this apartment because of the positive reviews, many say Stefan is highly responsive. Unfortunately that was not the case for us. At the end, hair dryer was not provided after reported not found in the apartment. The heater was not working and Stefan was not helpful with it. below 10°c rainy night without heater. We booked the apartment for 3 nights. On the last night, someone entered the apartment to drop us toilet papers and coffee capsule without informing us beforehand. He was informed by cleaner that those items were running low. Why didn’t he provide them on our first day? Note: The space between toilet bowl and wash basin is very narrow not for tall people. Only hair shampoo and hand-wash is provided. Building structure noise pollution at night not for light sleeper",NEGATIVE
"A horrible experience. I arrived at night and from the early morning there was no water at all in the apartment (not in the wc, shower, sink, etc. No water at all in the bathroom or kitchen). Apparently the host didn't know about it, but when in the morning I informed him about the problem and about my subsequent decision to leave, he made me pay anyway for this first horrible night and for the cleaning fees (he let me cancel the 2 following nights though). I had to go to work at a congress without taking a shower, without brushing my teeths and without properly using the wc. I found it especially contradictory that the host had made me sign a contract saying that I would have to pay extra money in case of several eventualities, such as breaking something, not throwing out the trash, not removing the bed sheets, not washing the dishes, etc, etc. etc. But then he didn't take responsibility for not providing something so basic such as providing water in the bathroom and kitchen.",NEGATIVE
"Olof was asking for sensible information (such as photo and number of ID). He was not providing any information on data privacy & data security. When asking him for it, he was not understanding and just said that I could cancel the reservation if I had any problem with it. This is against the law and not just something nice-to-have. For me this is a problem and I hope the owner will change this. The appartment itself is nice. Location is top. Size is ok for one person (for two persons, the bed would have been to small and uncomfortable for my taste). The appartment was very clean. One big downside is that the kitchen was not equipped so that one could actually cook something. The stove and oven and everything were great, but there was only a vary small pot without a lid, no spatula, and a very old, worn-off pan that one could not use anymore because the coating is damaged and will get into your food which is unhealthy. I recommend the owners to get some new kitchen equipment.",NEGATIVE
"The traffic was pretty loud with the windows open at night. Keeping the windows open was the only way to stay remotely cool. The rooms were very hot and the middle room that is cramped and closed off was the worst of all. Overall the stay was not that bad, but it was jsut miserable to sleep in with the noise and heat.",NEGATIVE
"Location is good. One block from the metro system that takes you everywhere you’d want to go. The apartment isn’t walk distance to the most wanted sightseeing area. Apartment is newly renovated but it’s an old layout. Spacious dining/kitchen and living room- furniture in the living room isn’t as shown on the Airbnb ad. Bedroom is tight, bed is against the wall, and not appropriate for a couple, so very uncomfortable. Couldn’t make the lights over closet area to work. We left one night earlier, paid a hotel closer to the airport, so we could have a good night sleep. Bathroom is very tight for American’ standards. Shower curtain doesn’t stop the water from running all over the place. Robin was communicating well before and at check in but he didn’t answer messages for 2 days and we had to call him to let him know we were leaving early. Overall we think it’s a okay place.",NEGATIVE
Did not match the photos,NEGATIVE
"Location is not that bad since you can quickly get to downtown by subway, however the neighbourhood surroudings are not interesting at all. Yes, it has a big shopping center nearby, but that's it. The apartment has privacy. Only one room, small space, but as advertised. The negative point was the cleaning. The bathroom was dirty, the floor was kinda sticky (disgusting, to be honest). Kitchen was dirty, with greasy plates, cutlery and pans, dirty oven, dirty fridge and with things spread on the floor. The bad linings and covers were dirty and smelly. The towels provided were also smelly. The whole apartment smelled like an ashtray. For me was not good since I was with a little kid. Although it has a good price, could be more clean. Hygiene should be basic, even if you are charging a low price.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment was disappointing. The walls and floor were dirty, and the bed sheets didn’t seem properly cleaned. There’s no smoke extractor in the kitchen, so cooking fills the studio with lingering smells. The stove barely works, requiring multiple attempts to ignite, and there’s no proper cooking knife. The bathroom is tiny, dominated by an oversized bathtub that wastes space. Noise is an issue, expect to hear neighbors leaving for work as early as 6:30 AM. The rules for using the washing machine were unclear, making it frustrating to coordinate. Worst of all, the host provided very poor assistance and was unresponsive to concerns. This place might be tolerable for young travelers planning a quick two-night stay with no intention of cooking. Beyond that, I wouldn’t recommend it.",NEGATIVE
"No, just no. Don’t book this stay or any other stay with this host. It’s a company that has put in system not to give you anything but the bare minimum. The first message you get from the host warns you that it’s not allowed to use their apartments for exchange of sexual services. So. I think that pretty much says it all. I checked into my booked apartment and found it left in shambles. Trash everywhere, old used towels, used sheets. Luckily the host could put me in a different apartment in the same building but that one didn’t have any functioning WiFi for half of my stay and there was barely any heating. Since the apartment is decorated with only the cheapest of the cheapest things, the covers were basically paper thin and didn’t provide any warmth at all. Ended up buying my own portable heater and blanket to be able to stay there. Host promised to have heating fixed but ofc that did not happen. Save yourself the headache of staying at a place completely without a soul. Just no.",NEGATIVE
"I recently stayed at this Airbnb and while the location was excellent, the experience left much to be desired. The bed was notably small and uncomfortable, which made for a restless stay. Additionally, the lack of basic amenities was a significant drawback. The garbage in the lobby wasn’t collected daily, leading to an unpleasant mess. Overall, while the location is a major advantage, the shortcomings in comfort and cleanliness were considerable.",NEGATIVE
"With over a dozen AirBnB stays, this is the first time I don't think I would stay again (unless significantly discounted). I was drawn in by the fairly reasonable price given the location, but arrived to find the front door jammed (which was a consistent issue through the stay). There was some stain/liquid residue on the bedside table which was a bit unsettling, and exposed wires inside the front door handle. The bathroom door handle was broken on arrival and ended up locking me in on one occasion (I would have been completely stuck if I didn't have another guest on the outside to assist me getting out). The paint in the unit appears to be the classic ""landlord-painted-everything-in-one-stroke"" style, which added to the careless feeling of the unit. Getting over all of that, the location was actually great and accessible for walking and transit, and the host team was very responsive to the chat. It was clean enough for a sleeping space, but I would need a steep discount to return.",NEGATIVE
"First I tried to contact him on his phone number or call him directly and he refused so the communication was only through airbnb which causes some slow response, second he did not tell me that the apartment is on the third floor and there is no elevator, and the stairs are difficult to climb, third there is an internet modem but it does not work and I contacted him and he told me that there is no internet! I had to leave the apartment at 11 and I asked him to give me until 12 and he refused. He was not positively committed to me",NEGATIVE
It was awesome but the heater that didn’t really warmed the room. The owner tried to help but it didn’t helped that much unfortunately,NEGATIVE
"This house is very old and even smelly. Only the ground floor is good. The first-floor toilet is quite small and the bathroom is unusable. I will NOT recommend this place to a group having more than 4 people because then you will struggle for toilet and bathroom. The house was not having even the basic things like towel hangers in bathrooms, toilet roll holder in first floor toilet. The items in the kitchen like cups etc are also very few. overall a bad place.",NEGATIVE
Unloved apartment,NEGATIVE
"I wanted to provide feedback regarding the internet service during my stay, as it significantly impacted my experience. Although I was informed that the internet was functioning, we encountered persistent issues despite trying various troubleshooting methods, including assistance from my own technical team. The connection was highly unreliable; while we were occasionally able to get it working, it would frequently drop out. Furthermore, only one computer could connect at a time when it was working, which was far from adequate. This inconsistency made my stay particularly stressful, especially as I rely on stable internet for business calls, including critical ones with the USA at 10 PM local time. Unfortunately, the lack of reliable internet rendered the accommodation unsuitable for business travelers like myself. I hope this feedback is helpful in addressing the issue and improving the service for future guests.",NEGATIVE
"Positive: almost every basic necessity is present (just no salt, pepper or sugar - now there is for the next guests and regretfully no washing machine). Negative: Very spartan, empty, very IKEA and styled without inspiration. It is quite a hike from the commuter train station. Especially with suitcases. Our internet connection didn’t work when we entered and it took 1,5 day to fix. The led lights have a life of their own but work most of the time. There is no manual for the apartment so we needed to ask in the host how to get the dishwasher to work. The host is a professional one, so there is no real connection or love for the apartment. The list you have to work through before leaving is extensive and -again with no information- we couldn’t find the trash disposal. Next time we are in Stockholm we’ll find another place. It’s not too bad, but I think one can easily do better.",NEGATIVE
"The appearance of the room and the furniture differed significantly from what was shown in the photos. The room's appearance was a key factor in the choice of accommodation. In the bathroom, the lack of a built-in drain caused flooding across the entire floor after each shower. Additionally, there were dead pharaoh ants found in the kettle. In addition, the owner provided a link to an external website with regulations that included additional penalties, such as charges for not cleaning up. This form also had an option to enter full credit card details. The website, however, was not secured in any way, did not require a password or login, and was accessible to anyone, which could potentially lead to money being stolen from the account.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment was really cold, we had to use more then 4 blankets to be able to sleep without freezing.",NEGATIVE
Just passed through for two night place was fine and sun a good location. Lights like other places in Sweden were low for Australia use. Missed the Change room from earlier emails. And this delayed the arrival a bit till sorted. Could not find where to leave the rubbish downstairs- tried but much clearer explanation would be better.,NEGATIVE
"If you’re staying during the colder season, I definitely do not recommend staying here—it’s really cold inside. One of the radiators wasn’t working, and I had to warm myself with a hair dryer.Indoor looked like around 15 degree. Maybe owner could leave extra blanket to the place. That said, the location is good, and the place is cozy, but it’s an older apartment, which affects the balance of the heating system.",NEGATIVE
"It was a smooth check-in experience at Andreas' place, and he responds quickly in case of any issues. However, a few things did not match my expectations for a peaceful holiday: - The requirements for booking confirmation were too strict (I even had to provide social media accounts of guests to confirm the booking), which I have never encountered before. - The noise monitors in the apartment felt intrusive. - The apartment is right next to the highway with constant traffic. It was difficult to have a peaceful sleep because I had to keep the windows open since there is no fan in the apartment.",NEGATIVE
"We had a nice stay in Stockholm in Andreas' appartment. Checkin and everything went smooth and the appartment was well prepared and ""made"" to be rented out as an AirBnB (seems like all the flats in that builing were AirBnBs). Most likely these appartments are student rooms that are rented out during the summer break - at least I hope that this is the case, otherwise it would leave a bitter side taste, knowing the rent situation in Stockholm. Only thing I did not like is that ""Andreas"" is acting like a real person, while there is clearly a rental company behind that profile. Even the profile picture is just a stock foto, which made me suspicious at first as I thought that I had fallen victim to a scammer first (Andreas had 88 places to rent when I checked ""his"" profile). Besides that, all good, I recommend the place for a stay in Stockholm. Thanks!",NEGATIVE
"We were a bit on edge about staying here as they have very strict and intimidating rules. We have stayed in a fair amount of AirBnBs over the years, we have always been clean and tidied up after ourselves. We didn't like that we needed to provide a picture of our passport through an external link and we had to sign a tenacy agreement through another link outside of AirBnB. Another point that we didn't like is that this Andreas portrays himself as a private host when it's clearly an agency behind it from the amount of property's they have. It's deceiving and it left us a bit on edge. Finally, we weren't supplied a key for the rubbish bins. We would have happily disposed of it as we always do but weren't able to. We messaged Andreas and he wasn't very helpful at the start, telling us to check the bins twice. We sent pics highlighting that you need a key. Eventually he said to just leave it for the cleaner. He should have just said this at that and save us the stress.",NEGATIVE
"The positive side of this flat is its relative proximity to the metro and therefore to the center of Stockholm. Several points did not meet our expectations: - It is managed by an agency, with impersonal communication (automated messages) - They require unjustified private information (ID copy, reason for the stay, relationship with other guests (!) etc) - The flat is old and needs maintenance. Only in the bedroom, the lamp wasn't functional, the doorknob was falling off and the window blinds were broken (making it very bright in the morning) - The pillows were tiny and uncomfortable - I forgot a valuable behind and the agency was unable to return it, although we offered to come and pick it up - There is constant background noise from the surrounding highways - There are no amenities in the neighbourhood In other words, this place is affordable for Stockholm, if you are willing to cope with the many inconveniences.",NEGATIVE
For the first time ever with airbnb apartment we couldn’t get inside because the host did not send us the code for the lockbox and was completely unresponsive - only sending automatic messages and not answering the phone. We ended up standing outside the apartment late in the evening with two small kids and had to call airbnb by their US number (costing extra money) and wait until they managed to locate the host. Before the trip the host was sending instructions with house rules which had to be marked as read but it was impossible to mark them or get any human response regarding this issue. Apartment was ok only much darker and older than in photos.,NEGATIVE
"Sadly the flat is not nearly as bright as shown on photos and actually gets very little natural light. The door to the bedroom is missing so there is no privacy. The kitchen & bathroom have no window or ventilation, and overall the flat does not feel very lived in. We felt it was a little expensive for what it was (sorry Olof!).",NEGATIVE
The apartment is nice but we had quite a few issues with the place. Even though Olof was responsive via message a lot of the messages weren’t helpful. It is very confusing to use the shower head and when I messaged to ask how it worked he asked me to send a photo and video of the shower (he clearly didn’t know what it looked like) and then he sent me several YouTube videos of how to work a shower head which looked completely different to the one in the apartment. We also needed to download an app to get into the apartment (as a key) but this wasn’t told to us until the night before which meant I had to download the app while travelling and figure out how to use it. There was also no instructions sent as to how to lock with the app (as this wasn’t clear). It’s maybe not a big deal to others but it’s also good to note that there is basically no natural light in the apartment and there is no door to the main bedroom. It is clean and well located but these details should be mentioned,NEGATIVE
"Host's sister made us feel guilty for checking into the airbnb at a later time. I have never heard of an airbnb host rushing somebody to check in and making the client feel guilty for that. I had to pay for an extra cab ride because of her. She said things like “If you are late you should have taken a cab here”. I had communicated with the host that my flight got delayed and that I was getting to the airbnb as fast as I possibly could. Also, when she came into the apartment to fix the internet, she gave a constant reminder that the apartment has to be cleaned up before we go. Yes, the apartment was messy when we were staying there, but that’s because we were still using the apartment. We left the place clean when we checked out and we were going to do that regardless of her many reminders. Internet was also unavailable for the first 5 days. Also, they constantly gave reminders of how great the deal is, but just because the deal is great doesn't mean you can talk to people this way.",NEGATIVE
"Unfriendly at check-in, nasty state of cleanliness (used condoms in bathtub and toilet, suspicious stains on the bedsheets and couch), demanded travel to a second location for check-out of keys. Doesn’t seem to be a serious host. Don’t recommend",NEGATIVE
"My partner and I arrived at the property at around midnight. The check in instructions told us to pick up the key from a lockbox. However, the lockbox was not there. We tried to contact the host but we did not receive a response until the next morning. After several calls with Airbnb, we were told to book alternative accommodation for the night. Airbnb had to cancel the reservation, and they provided us with the following reason why: “We need to cancel the reservation as the Host violated the Ground rules for Host that is set by Airbnb. We tried to save the reservation by providing the deadline to your Host to respond and resolve the issue, but Host failed to comply.” The following morning the host apologised for the lockbox not being in place. She told us that “the person that was responsible for leaving the lockbox and keys missed it”. Although she did invite us to stay at the property for the remaining nights, as Airbnb had cancelled the booking we decided to stay elsewhere.",NEGATIVE
"This is a spacious and comfortable apartment in a pleasant part of Stockholm. We had a few minor issues (missing light bulbs and extension cord, an incomprehensible fold-out love seat, no paper towel) and one major one (no wife info, then wifi with such a weak signal it only worked from one corner of the kitchen. We alerted Andreas and he responded, yet nothing was done about anything except giving a second wifi network, even weaker than the first one. Seems odd for a guy managing 91 listings, or maybe that’s the problem?",NEGATIVE
"Andreas did his best to make us feel comfortable and communication was smooth before and during the trip, thank you to Him. Getting to the apartment was easy thanks to Andreas' accurate information. Unfortunately we did not get the wifi password and even Andreas could not help us with that. We stayed with five people and I feel that the single bed in the apartment, which can be converted from a comfortable armchair, is not very comfortable for an adult. The pictures of the apartment correspond to the real condition. The rooms, bed linen , kitchen, cutlery and bathroom were very clean. For guests arriving in the summer, it may be important that the apartment can be darkened. Otherwise we had a very good time.",NEGATIVE
"The place is as described, but upon arrival the appartment was not cleaned. After asking for a small discount, the host refused. And after we left the appartment, the host accused us of leaving extensive mess, such as that we did not take the garbage out (there was no such instruction), not putting the cleaned dishes into the cupboards (we left them to dry on the side), and more, claiming almost 100€ for it. This was the first for me.",NEGATIVE
"We had a nice stay for a weekend at Elin’s, but it was very dark. The lack of light was very frustrating",NEGATIVE
"Positives: The place looks like the photos and the neighborhood is nice with nature. Negatives: The WiFi was almost never working, the apartment was dusty, right next to the highway so very loud with bad noise isolation, the bedroom door wasn't staying closed which was an issue because my friend and I were both having meetings at the same time, and the booking process was the most complicating I have ever experienced on AirBnB. Overall, even though it is a nice apartment, I cannot say I can recommend it since I would not stay here again.",NEGATIVE
"Positive: 5-10 minute walk to tram, spacious, nice kitchen with good equipment and a huge fridge Negative: the bed was broken, which made it sink in when two people laid in it, the dishwasher was full so we first had to take out the dishes, the light colored sofa had many stains, the ceiling in the bathroom seemed to be wet with yellow spots (mold?)",NEGATIVE
"The place itself match the pictures and has a lot of potential and is a good quality but considerably overpriced. I think the main issue was that it is a brand new Host and she is very weary and uncomfortable. Still with having someone in her home and can act really overprotective on the property, which makes it uncomfortable of a situation and not your typical Airbnb experience.",NEGATIVE
"+ It is close to central station. - Definitely not worth it considering its quality. - Room and kitchen are very small. - It was not unclean, but we definitely can't feel comfortable about cleanliness of the room. -Everything needs to be renewed, and walls need to be painted. Total overhaul is needed. - Yes, the amenities are exactly what it is written. But, when you pay that much money, of course you expect something more. Because we couldn't feel good over there, we requested early check out, Airbnb and landowner helped us to get refund a bit more than normal.",NEGATIVE
"My sister and I had high hopes for our stay here, but unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed upon arrival. The place was far from clean - the floors and surfaces were visibly dirty, and there was an unpleasant, heavy smell in the air that made it uncomfortable to breathe. My sister, who is allergic to dust, felt sick. Everything was dirty. It was truly not a space we felt we could relax in, so we decided to check out immediately and find a hotel last minute. This experience was very disappointing and didn’t meet the expectations set by the listing. I wouldn’t recommend this place for anyone seeking a clean and comfortable environment.",NEGATIVE
"The place was fine, but the host was unresponsive until about two hours before check in. I had questions regarding whether we could check in before 15.00. They ignored my question for more than 4 days, & they sent pre automated messages with smileys and 'dont hesitate to contact us' about trash handling before and during our stay. When traveling as a group internationally for holidays, it is extremely stressful to not be able to communicate and only receive bot answers. The place was very nice and ok clean, but old dust lumps under the bed and food in the freezer. Not a problem, but maybe something to consider. Cleaning instructions for departure was not your normal 'leave it clean as you found it', but detailed instructions demanding vacuum cleaning & washing floors. If this would have been communicated very clearly up front it would not have been a problem. WiFi, check in, overall quality was otherwise good.",NEGATIVE
"Unfortunately I cannot recommend this housing, and would not want to stay with this host in any of their housings. The place was not cleaned, it had much gravel on the bathroom floor, my white socks quickly got dirty from walking on the floor in the rest of the appartement, there were dead insects, greasy stove, heavily dirted/burned plate in the owen and much of the furniture was dirty/stained and seemed to have been brought from a dumpster. The remote control was clogged with dirt. I was promised cleaning from day one, which did not happen so I cancelled after two nights. Waiting for a full refund since the place under these conditions doesn't seems as a sanitary healthy place to stay. It seems the whole building is airbnb appartements. I got to see one option which was a little better, but also heavily dusty & with lots of animal hair. With a deep clean & clean furniture the place would be good. I hope Flatin will deal with this. Kitchen utils were clean and the area is nice.",NEGATIVE
"Overall the place is okay. You have somewhere to sleep, to have a shower and to prepare a meal for relatively okayish price in Stockholm. But if you would like to really enjoy your stay, it’s not the case here. Apartment is not very clean, since the host wants his tenants to clean after themselves (which is not mentioned in the listing), duvets have holes in them, stains on all the chairs, shower glass door is all dirty. There was no hair dryer and no iron, so if you have long hair - prepare to go to sleep with your hair wet and wake up with a sore throat, because it’s a bit chilly in the apartment. I contacted the host about the missing hair dryer, but nothing was done (considering that we were staying for 3 nights). So if you have very limited budget - it’s an okay place to stay.",NEGATIVE
He provided me with the wrong code and I waited 3 hours outside the apartment and he didn’t answer the phone and the phone number he have in he’s profile is off and not working.,NEGATIVE
"I had to point out to Flatin that the apartment is terribly dirty. Very dirty bed linens. A rotten smell in the whole apartment. Mess everywhere. The TV is not working. Flatin ""forgot"" for 2 days to call the cleaning team to clean the apartment. When the cleaning ladies came, they did a superficial cleaning, and the towels and bed linen they brought were also dirty and smelled bad. IT WAS A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT. He didn't even bother to answer. It took hours to get a reply to each message. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ACCOMMODATION TO ANYONE. HORRIBLE!!!",NEGATIVE
"The self-cleaning apparently does not work, some people simply leave a mess after them thinking that it is cleaned. The apartment needs thorough cleaning after each guest otherwise it will never be clean. The owner requests self cleaning but the equipment like vaccum cleaner is in a poor, hardly working condition.",NEGATIVE
"Not cleaned after previous guests, dirty towels left, no new towels on apartment, dusty, dirty, bathroom all wet after previous guests, communication with host without any point, problem not fixed, no interest showed, I would not reccommend apartment to no one ever, terrible service, not satisfied.",NEGATIVE
"First things first, despite informing the host that we had an infant, we were assigned a room on the 3rd floor in a building without an elevator or lighting at night. Second, on our check-in day, the host didn’t send us any instructions. When we arrived late at night, his responses were slow, and he mixed up the apartment assignments. We ended up searching for keys in someone else’s apartment, which was awkward and disruptive for other guests. Third, when we finally got into our apartment, it was quite messy and not very clean—there were hairs on the floor and noticeable dust. Fourth, although the listing mentioned a hairdryer, there wasn’t one in the apartment. After we texted the host, he slowly responded and promised to bring it immediately, but didn’t follow through. We had to leave with wet hair, and he finally left the hairdryer by the door late that evening, just before we had to check out. Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this place. The price and location are good, but it’s w",NEGATIVE
"“Misleading and Fraudulent Listing - Avoid” This was the worst Airbnb experience I’ve had. The photos are misleading, either very old photos or it’s been airbrushed. The property is poorly maintained—coffee machine broken, several lights out, and inconsistent heating. To top it off, there were dirty socks left under the bed from a previous guest and clumps of dust in corners of the room where it was poorly kept. Most concerning is that the listing is run by a business pretending to be an individual, using stock photo and most likely a fabricated bio and name. Nowhere is this disclosed. They also requested our social media handles and passports, leaving me worried about who has my personal information. This operation is dishonest and prioritizes profit over guest comfort. Avoid this listing at all costs.",NEGATIVE
"Small, but very clean and nice home. The only thing to consider is the size of the bathroom. Tha bathroom is very tight, it is not suitable for people who wear XL and XXL cloths.",NEGATIVE
"DO NOT STAY HERE! The beds are children's sized and propped up with 1 in L brackets made of an inch-thick wood that bends with weight. This place only has one shower for a supposed 11 guests. If you are unhappy with the listing, the host will also NOT refund you. We were very unhappy with the conditions are did not spend one of the 5 nights we reserved, and he offered no refund, no recourse, nothing and just took thousands of dollars from us. The area of town is also very unsafe. His clothes and belongings were everything and the apartment is unfinished with exposed sheetrock at the top. I just looks like he threw this place together to take advantage of people like ourselves. It's very sad that people and places like this exist and the photos are at an angle and do not represent the size of the beds or the accomodations that don't exist like only having one shower as we had 7 guests and that's unacceptable. I have stayed at many airbnbs in the past and this one was the WORST",NEGATIVE
"No heating, no hairdryer, old and cold house. The kitchen has nothing except of some utensils. Also an inconvenient location.",NEGATIVE
"The place looked fine in the photos and the host was very responsive and nice. The bathrooms were very clean and many. But unfortunately there was a lot of noise all through the night from some doors opening and closing, and it was so loud that it made our wall shake. It happened many times between 2am-5am, and it was very uncomfortable for my parents and I, particularly after seeing how tightly the bunk beds are squished into the room. There wasn’t even enough space to sit up on a bed and no chair in the room. In my opinion, it should be possible to at least on your own bed or sit on a chair in your own room. There also wasn’t enough space to walk through the beds to access the sleeping area, it’s barely enough space to fit even one person standing. This room should really only have one bunk bed, but the fact that there was a double bunk and a triple bunk is absurd. We decided to Stockholm early rather than continue our booking and stay here again. For the price, not worth it.",NEGATIVE
"Charlotta tried very hard, but it wasn't the best stay. The lights kept blinking all week, and the outlets were shaky at best. The oven door was broken. We would have liked to have some instructions for the stove/oven and the washer. The washer was in the kitchen, not in the hallway as was stated. This was not a problem, however. Directions would have been nice to have in the apartment since we were unable at times to get online. It was quite sketchy at times.",NEGATIVE
"The pictures of the property does not show the actual conditions. The apartment had not been properly cleaned before arrival, the bathroom smelled and the furniture was worn. Otherwise the communication with the host went fine.",NEGATIVE
